# Laurie Owen
(he/him)
I'm a theatre practitioner and educator based in Nottingham. I trained in Theatre and Performance at The University of Leeds, and have practised performing arts since 2009. I have been teaching performance skills to adults since 2018, and currently teach theatre workshops at Nottingham Playhouse.

I'm passionate about co-creating work that is entertaining, that captures the spirit of liveness, and that elevates marginalised perspectives. I am also a champion for increasing access to the theatre for the trans community, and I do this through my own creative work, and through educational and outreach initiatives.

Principles of improvisational theatre are at the core of my practice (particularly Johnstone and Spolin), hence, the name improvlaurie.
