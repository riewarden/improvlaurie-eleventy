I'm a theatre practitioner and educator based in Nottingham. I trained in Theatre and Performance at The University of Leeds, and have practised Performing Arts since 2009. I have been teaching performance skills to adults since 2018, and currently teach theatre workshops at Nottingham Playhouse. My pronouns are he/him.

I'm passionate about co-creating work that is entertaining, that captures the spirit of liveness, and that elevates marginalised perspectives. I am also a champion for increasing access to the theatre for the trans community, and I do this through my own creative work, and through educational and outreach initiatives. I'm also interested in programming and the indie web, and I handmade this website.
