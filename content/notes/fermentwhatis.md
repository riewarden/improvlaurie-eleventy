title: What is fermentation?
---
Fermentation involves cultivating an ideal environment for specific types of bacteria and/or yeast that do not harm human health. The microorganisms are encouraged to monopolise a food product, and in doing so, they metabolise parts of the food to keep themselves alive. This changes the flavour of the food, but also preserves it, because the monopoly of safe bacteria (often in conjunction with lack of oxygen) prevents dangerous bacteria from thriving.

I have a personal story relating to [[fermentation|why I started learning to ferment.]]
