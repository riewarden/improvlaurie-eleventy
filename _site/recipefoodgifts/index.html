    <h1>Really easy edible gifts</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>3 Nov 2024</p>
    <p>If you're short on cash, a personal gift can be really special and satisyfing to both give and receive. I think it's beautiful and radical to forgoe monetary expense for other qualities. There are actually lots of edible gifts that are simple and safe to make, even if you don't consider yourself very adept in the kitchen. I've provided some examples and tips, and a big list of resources for more ideas and inspiration.</p>
<p>This should go without saying, but follow your recipe carefully and make sure your gift containers are clean. The following are the most low-effort edible gifts that involve minimal prep time, and no baking/cooking.</p>
<h2>Infused alcohol</h2>
<p>Sloe gin, rhubarb gin, limoncello, alcohol infused with Xmas spices, bitters, etc. As long as these are made with spirits, and ingredients are either covered, or the bottle is shaken up every day or two, they will stay safe at room temperature due to alcohol content. Once infusion is finished, strain off the fruit/spices etc to reduce the risk of ingredients becoming exposed to oxygen, which could give mould a place to grow. Should keep shelf stable, after straining, for several months.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/limoncello">Limoncello</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/christmas_pudding_vodka_45343">Christmas Pudding Vodka</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/sloe-gin">Sloe Gin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/homemade-vanilla-extract">Vanilla Extract</a> Traditional single or double-proof vanilla extract is just a type of infused alcohol, but with specific proportions of just two ingredients: vanilla pods, and high-proof spirit. The ingredients can be a bit pricey, depending on how much you make at one time, and it takes several months to taste really good, but it's very easy to make, and can be topped up with spirit multiple times, making it last much longer than a commercial version. It will be an incredible gift for an avid baker.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shelf stable pre-mixes</h2>
<p>These are mixes of ingredients that would separately be stored at room temperature anyway, such as:
Infused sugars and salts with herbs/spices, DIY cookie jars (premixed dry ingredients for cookies) and herbal tea blends.</p>
<h3>Tea blend digression</h3>
<p>With tea blends, you can easily make a cheap version of a favourite brand-name loose-leaf tea blend by checking the ingredients on said tea, buying the ingredients, and blending it yourself. I reccomend doing small test batches of the tea to ensure you have the right proportions before committing to a big batch.</p>
<p>Also, avoid buying powdered herbs and spices, and if possible, buy the whole spice and grind to a tea-leaf consistency, so that it doesn't make the tea gritty. Buying the ingredients can work out a bit expensive, but it will be nowhere near the same price of the brand-name blended tea.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/lavender-sugar">Lavender Sugar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://marmaladeandme.com/triple-chocolate-cookie-mix/">Triple Chocolate DIY Cookie Jar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nourishedkitchen.com/sleepy-tea-recipe/">Sleepy tea blend</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/masala-chai">Masala Chai</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Vinegar-based pickles</h2>
<p>If not canning, fill the jar as full as possible with pickling liquid. There needs to be minimal headroom and low pH to prevent bacteria growing. The pickle should be able to stay sealed at room temp until opened, at which point should be put in fridge, but do as the recipe advises.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/recipes/bread-and-butter-pickles/">Hawksmoor Pickles</a> The sliced cucumber kind. Quite sweet and McDonalds-y. You could easily reduce the sugar if you wanted to.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/quick-pickled-onions">Pickled red onions</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>To avoid</h2>
<p><strong>Infused oils</strong> – I see these on a lot of Christmas gift articles, but without canning, homemade infused oils have a much higher botulism risk than other such gifts. Oils with ingredients suspended in them create an oxygen-deprived, low-acid environment, which is where botulism spores thrive the most effectively.</p>
<h2>General tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upcycle containers and bottles, but make sure what you’re using is safe. Make sure containers are airtight, and sterilised where possible before using. You can sterilise glass containers and their lids by washing thoroughly with hot soapy water, then putting in a low oven for 20 mins.</li>
<li>If you’re taking your gift out of the fridge temporarily to take it to someone, products like curd, chutney, jam, etc, will usually be safe out of the fridge for a few hours with lid on, because of their high sugar, low pH, or a combination of both.</li>
<li>Go to town on labels! Look up pictures of apothecary labels or historical examples of sweetshop labels. Borrow the unusual words of another time. if you don’t like drawing, use stickers or collage, or upcycled cardboard packaging.</li>
<li>Pair your food gift with something that complements it. E.g, pair some amaretti biscuits with a bag of coffee beans, pair an infused alcohol with a mixer, or a pretty glass.</li>
</ul>
