    <h1>Wormhole Props Part 1 - How to make a big silly prop, start here</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>25 Mar 2025</p>
    <p>This is part 1 of a 3-part series about everything I have learned so far about designing props for Club Wormhole, a comedy cabaret that I help to produce in Nottingham.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="/blg-whprops3">Click here to read Part 3 - Building and painting a prop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the series I emphasise how to make props as cheaply as possible, while still aiming for strong aesthestics and functionality. I'm also very concerned about environmental sustainability, so my builds tend to be designed to make use of waste materials, and with consideration for how they will be reused or disposed of responsibly at some point in the future (which also saves money).</p>
<p>This is not a guide about making realistic-looking props. I basically want to share what I have learned about making big silly props for a comedy show, with minimum stress, no budget and no time (I usually have a handful of evenings throughout the month before a show). This guide is about making props that are cartoonish, larger than life, and silly.</p>
<p>In this first part, I explain how I come up with an idea for a prop for a Wormhole show.</p>
<h2>Coming up with a prop idea</h2>
<h3>Identify your existing materials</h3>
<p>The most readily available material I have access to is cardboard. A lot of cardboard is discarded at my workplace, and it is easy for me to take it home in my rucksack. Cardboard is flexible, but can be made strong. It is light and easy to paint. It can be destroyed easily on stage, without incurring a lot of financial expense. Cardboard's main disadvantage is that it's not waterproof. To make my crafting low-stress, environmentally sustainable and cheap, all of my prop ideas emanate from the fact that I have access to lots of cardboard.</p>
<p>Where possible I use materials that I can get for free, or I buy them second-hand. Sometimes this isn't possible, but I only buy new if all other options for free or second-hand are exhausted. Sometimes the props I make are limited by the materials that I can acquire in abundance, and I try to see this as a creative challenge, not as a hinderance.</p>
<h3>Decide on the purpose of the prop</h3>
<p>If the prop was a character in your show, how is the show made better by its inclusion? This doesn't have to be intellectual. I like to make props that are a visual punchline when they are revealed, or, which can move in a way that is funny or visually interesting, or I make props which I think will simply delight the audience when they see them, and make them wish to play with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <em>Defying Amity</em>, Jamie asked me for a shark fin which the audience could pass between them, to create the effect of the shark moving through water. I made a fin, and attached it to a long handle, and added a blue fringe of crepe paper that could rustle and move like ripples of water. Just by moving the fin slightly, the crepe paper starts moving, and so the audience can create the water effect we want, without having to have it explained to them. The texture was inspired by certain Cartoneria decorations, like pinatas, which use layered fringes of crepe paper to create effects.</li>
<li>Also for <em>Defying Amity</em>, Jamie asked for a big syringe, like the one that is used in the Jaws film, when the crew of the Orca try and poison the shark. I thought it would be fun if there was a way to make it look like the syringe was being plunged. I wondered if I had seen something like this before, and remembered pop-up books, which often have pull-tabs, so a child can pull a hidden piece of cardboard and make something move on the page. I found a tutorial online for how to do this, and I basically made a scaled-up version, but in the shape of a syringe.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Find a look and feel for the prop</h3>
<p>To figure out what I want a prop to look like, I usually go use a search engine to look for cartoon versions of the prop, and compare these with photographs of the prop. You shouldn't steal an artist's distinctive style, but good cartoonists know how to take complex objects and break them down into simple shapes, symbols and silhouettes. You can learn a lot from observing the work of many cartoonists, and understanding how they each break down an object in their own way. For your prop to have an effective design, you need to make sure the audience can understand what it is as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As you are looking at reference images, write down notes and draw doodles that answer the following questions. (E.g: Imagine you want to make a <strong>[polar bear]</strong> prop, but substitute <strong>[polar bear]</strong> for anything).</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the first three things I notice about a <strong>[polar bear]</strong>? (Keep these to single words.)</li>
<li>How should the audience react emotionally when they see the <strong>[polar bear]</strong>? (scared, laugh, 'awww cute', etc)</li>
<li>Are there any sensorial things that you would expect from being in the same space as a <strong>[polar bear]</strong> (e.g soft fur, growl, fishy smell, sharp claws)</li>
<li>Is there anything an audience might mistake a <strong>[polar bear]</strong> prop for, and is there anything I can incorporate into my design that will help them understand that this definitely is a <strong>[polar bear]</strong>? (e.g, they might think it's supposed to be an arctic husky dog, so I will make sure the design includes rounded ears, and a fish hanging from its jaws)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I think silhouettes are very important for designing a prop that the audience can quickly understand when they see it.</strong> If you want to know more about why this is, look up 'negative space' or 'ma'. Essentially, what you need to think about is: if your prop had no paint on it, how could the audience still guess what it was? You should have some sort of answer to this question in order to generate a strong design. This might not simply be down to the shape, it might also suggest a texture, or a movement that the prop should have.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <em>The Heist</em>, I designed a giant 2D wristwatch, which Rosa held up, and shouted into, as if it was a 'spy watch' with a microphone. I decided that I wanted to make it as three parts that joined together, a watch face with wrist straps attached either side. This meant when Rosa held it up by one of the straps, the pieces dangled together, like a real wristwatch (giving it a strong silhouette). I also decided I would draw second and minute hands on the clock face, but not bother with the numbers. I felt that the clock hands were sufficient enough to show the audience what the prop was, and that adding numbers would be nice, but wasn't necessary, particularly as I had two other props of a similar complexity to make within the month.</li>
