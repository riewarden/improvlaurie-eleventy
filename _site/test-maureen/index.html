    <h1>Directing Testimonial - Maureen Nwabueze</h1>

    <p>&quot;Laurie is an absolute dream to work with. He is a force of nature, yet his directing style is calm, measured, and quietly confident—qualities that he effortlessly instils in his actors. He directed me in The Prince, and as someone with significant dyslexia, I initially found reading and understanding Shakespearean text very challenging. Laurie took the time to patiently break down the text with me, ensuring I fully understood it, and helped me shape a strong and confident performance. He is an exceptional director, and I have absolutely no doubt he has a brilliant future ahead of him. I can’t wait to see it! I would absolutely love to work with him again, and any actor would be extremely lucky to do so. The industry needs a man like him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In our society, we need more trans voices creating and directing stories. As a trans man, Laurie brings an invaluable perspective to his work, and I believe he will help cultivate a richer, more inclusive creative landscape. I hope—and fully expect—that he will be part of a new renaissance in film and theatre, where stories from diverse communities, including the trans community, are seen and heard far more often.&quot;</p>
