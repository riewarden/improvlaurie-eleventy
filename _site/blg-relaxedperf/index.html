    <h1>Staging a relaxed performance on (almost) no budget</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>5 Jan 2026</p>
    <p>Often, amateur (and professional) theatres do not offer relaxed performances because they are anxious about it being too expensive. However, around July 2025, I discovered that <a href="https://www.leosmtc.co.uk/upcoming-productions">'Long Eaton Operatic Society'</a>, a relatively small amateur company, had started offering relaxed performances at almost all of their productions. Part of this had come from the fact that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1013472373725376">LEOS champions disabled performers within their productions.</a> I thought, <em>'If LEOS are doing this regularly, it must be easier and cheaper to do relaxed performances than everyone seems to think it is.'</em></p>
<p>I became interested in seeing if a relaxed performance was possible at my own amateur society - 'Lace Market Theatre' (or 'LMT'), and, if doing so would encourage new audience members to experience live theatre.</p>
<p>I successfully staged the relaxed performance, it had some great feedback, and so I have written a blog about how we did it, to encourage other directors and producers of all levels of 'professsionalism', to explore the concept.</p>
<h2>What is a 'relaxed performance'?</h2>
<p><a href="https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/what-is-a-relaxed-performance/">'Official London Theatre'</a>, a not-for-profit organisation representing the theatre industry, says:</p>
<p><em>&quot;A relaxed performance is a show that’s been adapted to suit people who might require a more relaxed environment when going to the theatre. Common triggers are darkness, loud music, sudden noises and a generally unfamiliar environment in which you’re expected to sit still and quiet for a long time.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A misconception about relaxed performances is that they 'censor a show to stop it offending people'. In actuality, however, relaxed performances have been championed by disabled theatremakers like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/26/relaxed-performances-theatre-families-disability">Jess Thom</a>, and the aim is for the <strong>environment of a show to be adapted.</strong></p>
<p>These adaptations support the needs of disabled people who struggle to conform to the unwritten social rules of a typical theatre environment. Paul Richards, a musician with ADHD, wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@paulrichards_75021/relaxed-performances-7d9944ca9501">this article</a> which includes several incidents he has witnessed where disabled people were made to feel unwelcome at live events.</p>
<p>Relaxed performances create dedicated spaces where people are welcomed into the theatre, who would otherwise not come at all.</p>
<h2>The Last Noel</h2>
<p>I directed a production of Chris Bush's play with music, 'The Last Noel'. I'll explain the budget we were working with, and even if you have absolutely no budget, please keep reading. I promise there's still a lot you can do for free!</p>
<h3>Our budget</h3>
<p>Everyone involved in the production (and the theatre more widely) was an unpaid volunteer, and we were given a total production budget of £450. This is a standard budget given to LMT studio shows, and had to cover most things you would expect to buy as part of a show, except costume, venue, rehearsal hire, marketing and performance rights, which LMT budgets for separately.</p>
<p>For the average amateur production, I think £450 is a lot of money, not to mention all the extra costs that LMT covers, but, compared to a professional touring company, or in-house production at a brick-and-mortar theatre, £450 is not a lot of money at all.</p>
<p>I make this point, because people think that making a performance accessible in any way is impossible unless you spend a lot of money, and this just isn't true. It's all about scope, which I will talk about in more depth later in the article.</p>
<h2>The Lasting Project</h2>
<p>When you first start thinking about a relaxed performance, you should contact 'The Lasting Project' (contact details at the end of the article). They are a non-profit organisation who have staged many relaxed performances with 'Long Eaton Operatic Society'. They gave me support and advice throughout the whole production process.</p>
<p>I met with one of their reps, Becky, early in my creative process, to discuss the show and ensure that a relaxed performance was feasible. I also invited the rep to my production meeting, so that she could hear from the technicians and backstage crew about their roles and responsibilities, and answer any questions.</p>
<p>TLP offered connections to freelancers who could do various services for us to support the performance, at an affordable rate for an amateur theatre, and we chose to pay one of their contacts to design and deliver a touch tour, which was £60. They also shared examples of other materials they had used on other shows, so that we could make our own content (e.g informational emails, and a video tour of the theatre). Becky also briefed all the venue staff and the theatre company at the dress rehearsal, and on the day of the relaxed performance.</p>
<p>'The Lasting Project' requested that we mentioned them in the programme, to help get the word out about their work, and to let them ask for contributions to a donation bucket at the end of the show.</p>
<h2>Planning stages</h2>
<p>So, how do you appraise your script, and identify things that may need to be altered for a relaxed performance? Before auditions, go through the script and note down anything like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loud noises</li>
<li>Bright flashing lights/colours</li>
<li>Surprises</li>
<li>Anything that inspires high emotion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't start by thinking 'oh no, I'll have to cut this'. The idea of a relaxed performance is to not censor difficult material, but to adapt how it is presented, for people who need more support to handle it.</p>
<p>Think about ways you could reduce the impact of problematic parts of the script without cutting them or changing the words (which you may not even be allowed to do, depending on the license of the play). For example, you could have an optional 'sensory synopsis' booklet which is a pamplet that can be made available on box office that provides a breakdown of each scene in the show, and warns people about loud noises or anything that could be overstimulating.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: Is it possible to do the whole show with house lights up? If not, could you just take out lighting cues which are sudden, or, amend the lighting cue file so that there are lighting effects, but the auditorium is never in full darkness.</p>
<p>You may want to talk to your technicians, and see what they think, or if they know of any shows where these problems were solved.</p>
<p>If trying to adapt the show changes it into something completely different than your original artistic intention, your show may not be adaptable for a relaxed performance, or, you may want to chat to 'The Lasting Project' and see if they have any ideas. It may just be that you're overthinking it.</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>You may not be able to accomodate every single disability at your venue. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't bother offering a relaxed performance, it just means that you should define what accomodations you can and can't make.</p>
<p>For example, LMT is sadly not wheelchair accessible. However, inour marketing, we explained that limitation, and still offered a relaxed performance that was advertised as suitable for autistic people, people with Tourettes/tics, people with dementia, people with learning disabilities, visually impaired people, d/Deaf people.</p>
<p>The outcome was still an opportunity to welcome people into the theatre who would otherwise not come at all.</p>
<h2>Why I decided to try The Last Noel as a relaxed performance</h2>
<h3>The script was a great way for the whole theatre to 'trial run' a relaxed performance</h3>
<p>I first decided to try doing 'The Last Noel' as a relaxed performance, because from my first reading of the script, it was clear that there is no part of the plot that hinges on the audience witnessing loud noises, flashing lights, lots of shouting, or shocking moments as you might need for a horror or thriller, etc. so, immediately, it came across as a show where the production itself would be uncomplicated to adapt.</p>
<p>The simplicity of adapting the show itself was important to me, as LMT had never offered a relaxed performance before. I knew there could be logistical challenges at the theatre in staffing the performance with extra front-of-house volunteers, and marketing the show effectively to the target audience. Having a production that needed little adaptation from the standard performance to the relaxed performance meant that the overall to-do list was significantly shorter.</p>
<p>But I don't think a show needs to be 'simple' in order to be considered for a relaxed performance. It's worth keeping in mind that pantomimes often offer relaxed performances, so, even if your show is more visually and auditorially stimulating, there are probably still ways it can be adapted.</p>
<p>To summarise, I felt the show was a small enough scale that it was a good opportunity for the whole theatre, including backstage, technicians, marketing, and customer services, to figure out what our theatre needed to put in place to offer a relaxed performance.</p>
<h3>The standard performance didn't need to be changed, just scaffolded.</h3>
<p>I loved the storytelling and characterisation in 'The Last Noel', and in the standard performance, I wanted the show to come to life in the audience's imagination, and not through lighting and sound effects. The standard show had three lighting cues, and one quiet sound cue. We ended up not even needing to adapt these, because the lighting cues still kept the auditorium sufficiently illuminated, had anyone wanted to leave.</p>
<p>'The Last Noel' does deal with some difficult emotions, and doesn't have the most upbeat ending, but I felt these aspects could be easily supported, or scaffolded, by a <strong>sensory synopsis</strong>. A sensory synopsis is a breakdown of every scene in the play, with notes that may be helpful for people with sensory/learning disabilities, or people who otherwise avoid surprises. It can be read before or during the show.</p>
<p>I based my sensory synopsis off one created by Disney for their production of 'The Lion King'. You can compare the two below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dwzhqvxaz/image/upload/v1684313457/Titles/The%20Lion%20King%20%28Lyceum%29/DisneysTheLionKing_SensorySynopsis_May23.pdf">The Lion King</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/pdfs/TLN-sensory-synop.pdf">The Last Noel</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>The show had a short running time, and the space was easy to move around in.</h3>
<p>'The Last Noel' has a 1 hr 10 min running time, and my production took place in a small studio theatre where the seating was easy to reconfigure, and was easy to leave and re-enter. That immediately meant that the show was more accessible for people who get fatigued easily, or who struggle to sit still for long periods of time.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Overall, very few changes were needed to make the performance 'relaxed'. But also, knowing from the start that I wanted to do a relaxed performance meant that I didn't accidentally introduce anything to the default show that was then difficult to adapt.</p>
<p>This is why you should decide whether or not to do a relaxed performance very early after you accept the role of Director, and not a few weeks before you open!</p>
<h2>Ticketing</h2>
<p>Co-ordinate with customer services and whoever manages the venue website, as early as possible, and find a way to ticket the show that works for everyone. I started this conversation a month before the show, which was much too late, and put unnecessary pressure on the person in charge of that department. If your company has never done a relaxed performance, I would reccomend to check in with customer services (and marketing) at least three months before the show.</p>
<p>We reduced ticketing on the relaxed performance to about half, to give the audience members in attendance more space to move around, and choose where they wanted to sit.</p>
<p>Crucially, you need to prevent people from accidentally booking a ticket to the relaxed performance, without realising what it is!</p>
<p>For 'The Last Noel', we didn't put the performance on general sale, and instead created a page that explained what the relaxed performance was, and asked people to contact box office to book, and let us know of any additional accomodations. This wasn't a perfect solution, as people could not book in advance, and we didn't have as good a record of their details when we needed to email additional information. We were partly restricted by the limitations of the theatre website, which pulls all its information for one show from one database entry, and provided limited capacity to customise pages outside of this design.</p>
<p>Afterwards, myself, customer services, and our web co-ordinator agreed that a better option for LMT to try would be to create a separate database entry, just for the relaxed performance, as though it was a different show. This would still distinguish the show from the standard show, but allow people to book in advance.</p>
<h2>Audience Information</h2>
<p>We asked around, and Googled, and acquired the names of various local charities that supported local people with disabilities. The Lasting Project also invited people from their networks.</p>
<p>We emailed groups with information about what accomodations to expect at the relaxed performance, and who it was aimed at. I also made a simple graphic on Canva with a summary of this information, which could be shared on social media by the marketing team, and members of my company.</p>
<p>A few days before the show, we sent out an email to everyone who had booked tickets, with extra info about what to expect, and timings for the evening (e.g we had a tour of the theatre, and a touch tour before the performance).</p>
<p>We also shot a simple 1-min video on a phone, in one take, with one of our company introducing the theatre, and showing the key areas that the audience needed to know about, i.e the box office, the bar, and the playing space.</p>
<h2>The night of the show</h2>
<p>Here is how the night of our relaxed performance went:</p>
<p><strong>5:30pm</strong> - Front of House arrive for a briefing with The Lasting Project</p>
<p><strong>6:00-6:30pm</strong> - Tour of theatre, led by theatre volunteers, for a school group of SEND young people.</p>
<p><strong>6:30-7:00pm</strong> - Touch tour led by a contact provided by The Lasting Project.</p>
<p><strong>7:15pm</strong> - Show preset starts (This was a standard part of all performances of The Last Noel where our actors came into the playing space in character, before the start of the show and asked audience to help decorate the stage)</p>
<p><strong>7:30pm</strong> - Show starts</p>
<p><strong>9:45pm</strong> - Show ends</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think everyone involved with a theatre company at any level of professionalism should imagine a world where their company does relaxed performances. To find out more, look at the resources below:</p>
