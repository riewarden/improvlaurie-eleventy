    <h1>Wormhole Props Part 3 - Building and painting a prop</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>25 Mar 2025</p>
    <p>This is part 3 of a 3-part series on how I make props for Club Wormhole.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blg-whprops1">Click here to read Part 1 - Getting the idea for a prop</a></li>
<li><a href="/blg-whprops2">Click here to read Part 2 - Drawing a plan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I explain how I use a drawing to build props out of cardboard.</p>
<p>Exactly how you build your props will vary depending on the materials you use, and I'm going to focus on cardboard in this article because it's what I am most familliar with, and it's quite easy to work with.</p>
<h2>Cutting out pieces</h2>
<p>I measure using a long ruler, .5 or .8 meter at least, and I have an A2 self-healing cutting board with a 1cm grid on it. Cutting mats are expensive if bought new but often sold second-hand for cheap. I generally cut large pieces of cardboard with a utility knife, and use scissors, box cutter, or craft knife for smaller details. Utility knives are much less effort than scissors.</p>
<p>TIP: When you mark measurements on cardboard to be cut up, don't mark the length with a little dash, instead, mark your lengths on either side of the place you're going to cut with a 'V', with the point of the V emanating from the point on the ruler. Then, when you lay your ruler on the cardboard to join the two points, it's much easier to see exactly where the line should be. This is how carpenters often measure and mark. If you need a demo, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuEz8TtrfjM">this video shows you have to do it.</a></p>
<h2>Attaching them together</h2>
<p>Cardboard can be attached together in lots of different ways, each for different purposes.</p>
<h3>Kraft Tape</h3>
<p>For taping cardboard, I only use kraft tape, and not sellotape. Kraft tape is a generic name for tape that is made from paper.  It's my go-to because the good brands hold well, it can be easily painted on, it's usually recyclable, and it can give a very neat finish to a cardboard build, smoothing rough edges, and making the whole thing look like one object.</p>
<p>Go for office brands, designed for mailing parcels, rather than flimsy ones from supermarkets designed for wrapping Christmas presents. Masking tape looks similar, but is not the same, as it is designed to come away easily, so it is therefore unreliable. You should only use it for temporarily attaching things.</p>
<p>Kraft tape is great for securing joints in 3D builds, and there is a brilliant book on Internet Archive called <em>Cut Fold and Hold</em> by Petra Schröder, about using kraft tape carefully in order to make sleek, sturdy, Scandi-style cardboard furniture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/cutfoldholduniqu0000schr">Read it here.</a> In some cases, I only need kraft tape to secure everything in a build, and glue isn't necessary.</p>
<p>Drawbacks: Sometimes, you can't make kraft tape look smart, or, kraft tape just isn't strong enough to firmly secure something very big. Additionally, if you put kraft tape in the wrong place, and leave it too long it can damage the surface of the cardboard when you remove it.</p>
<h3>Glue</h3>
<p>If you need to secure something very rigidly, or if you require an aesthetic finish that tape is just not going to work for, go for glue. In general, I prefer wood glue over PVA. Wood glue is more expensive than PVA, but the stress and time that it saves is well worth it, in my opinion. Wood glue applies the same way as PVA, but it is stronger, you need less of it, and it dries faster. If the two pieces being glued need to be held together, I use cheap plastic clamps or clothes pegs to do this, so I can get on with something else. Apparently bulk containers of PVA sold in DIY/Construction shops, intended for building work, is a very similar to wood glue.</p>
<p>Always apply glue right around the edges of the area to be attached, and make sure you roughly cover a significant proportion of the surface area. You don't need to cover every inch, but just enough that when it dries, it can't be easily pulled apart.</p>
<h3>Cross-graining</h3>
<p>Corrugated cardboard has a grain that behaves similarly to plywood. If you have two layers of cardboard, one with a grain running vertically, and the other horizontally, and you glue them on top of each other, they make a composite that is very strong. This will still work, even if one of the layers is a patchwork of one grain made from lots of pieces of scrap cardboard. Ideally, you want the ugly side where the audience can't see it well. Sometimes if I need a really big piece of cardboard, I will attach two smaller pieces together, by gluing a line of squares with opposing grain onto the join.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a helpful animation showing how plywood is made:</p>

<h2>Painting/finishing</h2>
<p>The cheapest paints around are poster paints, but, I don't bother with these, because the finish is often inconsistent and dull, and the quality of the paint is so watery that it damages the cardboard. If you have very little money, I think you would be better off designing props intended to be decorated with one colour of acrylic paint, or with thick black marker pens (in a monochrome style), and buy one new tube of acrylic colour for each project, until you have a collection.</p>
<h3>POSCA Paint Markers</h3>
<p>These are great, especially if you don't have a lot of time or space to work. They are marker pens with a barrel inside, filled with water-based highly pigmented paint. Essentially, you can draw whatever you like on many kinds of surface, and the colours will come out flat and bright. They dry very quickly, don't require water, and create almost no mess. They last a long time and the pens themselves don't dry out. Even people who are not confident with paints can draw a big doodle on some card, colour it in, and have a 2D prop in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of space to build in, and it's great to not have to get out lots of paints and water every time I do a project, or when I need to add a small detail. I got a pack of POSCA's biggest size, the 8K, second-hand new on Vinted for £15.</p>
<p>Drawbacks: Expensive if bought new (the pack of 8K is £30 new). They're also not good for large surface areas. They are bright in comparison to most other craft paints, but not as bright as acrylic, particularly on dark surfaces.</p>
<h3>Acrylic Paints</h3>
<p>Acrylic paints are fast-drying, highly pigmented paints, usually sold in tubes. A little acrylic can go a long way, and if you use a slightly damp brush, this will help get the most out of them. Be aware that acrylic starts to dry within a minute, so don't get out too much at once, and clean your brushes with soap and water immediately after you finish a painting session. I wish I could give more advice about 'how' to paint, but I just wing it at the moment. Wormhole member Katie Mitchell would be the expert on that, as she's a proper painter.</p>
<p>Drawbacks: Acrylics can work out expensive, particularly for big builds. You can often buy big containers of black and white acrylic paint on second-hand stores like Vinted and Ebay. If you just want to cover something with white, Acrylic Gesso is usually cheaper than acrylic paint. 'Student grade' ranges of acrylic are cheaper than 'artist grade'.</p>
<p><strong>Paint exchanges</strong>
Many cities have Paint Exchanges, where people who have bought paint in bulk for their house, and have some leftover, can give it away, or a charity can sell it at a discount. I haven't tried using house paints as part of a build but I don't see why not. Just be careful to not mix different kinds of paint. They will most likely react unpredictably with each other.</p>
<h2>You have a prop!</h2>
<p>If you have followed all the steps I described, you should now have a prop! If it's not perfect, you will have learned a lot throughout this process, and your next prop will be even better. For now, test it out, send some photos of it to your friends, and bask in the glory of having Created.</p>
