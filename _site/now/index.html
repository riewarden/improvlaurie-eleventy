        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>26 Jul 2024</p>
    <ul>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> The Practice and Theory of Anarchism by Ruth Kinna, as well as two original plays from Lace Market Theatre members.</li>
<li><strong>Watching:</strong> Kaos, Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey, SortedFood, Gastronauts, Make Some Noise.</li>
<li><strong>Listening to:</strong> <a href="https://radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a>, which is a community internet radio that just always seems to be playing awesome music. I love their interface too, which shows the lyrics of the song playing, as well as album art, and a Wikipedia entry for the artist, as well as a box where you can see comments left by listeners over the years on currently playing songs.</li>
<li><strong>Wearing:</strong> Red ski jacket, as it's cold out. I also had my <a href="/badgejacket">photo taken in my badge jacket at CityArts</a>, so I've been trying to wear it more in case people recognise my cool jacket! Thanks to James, I'm also wearing <a href="https://www.ppu.org.uk/remembrance-white-poppies">a white poppy on behalf of the Peace Pledge Union</a>, as it's the month of Rememberance.</li>
<li><strong>Excited about:</strong> My involvement in the <a href="https://www.nae.org.uk/reside-notts-trans-hub/">Notts Trans Hub residency at The New Art Exchange</a>. It's such a cool place and I am going to be doing a thing there on the 30th November (watch this space). Thinking about directing The Prince at Lace Market Theatre next year. I keep talking to people who are excited and who think I will do a great job. My sister's wedding is in less than two days!!! omg!!! and Rory has an amazing outfit for it, and I bought my first proper suit, not just random bits and bobs from supermarkets. Me and James are heading to Fake Christmas in December, we made some special pickles the other day. My secret santa gift arrived and its AMAZING and I can't wait for it to be opened.</li>
<li><strong>Annoyed about:</strong> My job!! Won't go into it. Also, that people don't preserve much food in the UK and I would like for there to be more learning resources and training, so that people would be able to use up food more and stop it going to waste.</li>
<li><strong>Planning for:</strong>  Me and Rory are planning to make some tasty treats for Christmas......what could they beeee??</li>
</ul>
