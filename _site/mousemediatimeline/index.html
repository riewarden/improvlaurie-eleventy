    <h1>Mouse Media Timeline</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>12 Jan 2026</p>
    <p>A non-comprehensive timeline of media featuring anthropomorphic mice. I've also included other cultural events relating to mice that seem relevant and influential to a public preoccupation with mice. If you know of any media that you think I should add, especially media that is not in English, feel free to email me at <strong>laurence(@)improvlaurie(.)co(.)uk</strong> - minus the brackets.</p>
<h4>Classical Times</h4>
<p>'Town Mouse and Country Mouse' told and referenced by various, including Babrius, Horace, Marcus Aurelius, Aesop.</p>
<h4>circa 1129 BC</h4>
<p>Satirical Papyruses are produced in Egypt, depicting mice and other animals performing human activities. Like, for example, this scene where a cat is depicted as a butler to the mouse.
<img src="/assets/mousemedia/mmtl-papyrus.jpg" alt="ancient papyrus, where a cat is depicted as a butler to the mouse"></p>
<h4>12th Century</h4>
<p>Walter of England adapts 'Town Mouse and Country Mouse' into Latin, and it is adapted across Medieval Europe.</p>
<h4>1895</h4>
<p>The National Mouse Club is established in the UK (A mouse breeding and mouse fancier society). The website for TNMC states the following:</p>
<p><em>&quot;The fancy mouse embodies all that is needed for a display of showmanship. A true exhibition mouse combines beauty and elegance on a small scale which, when achieved, will bring great satisfaction to the exhibitor.&quot;</em></p>
<h4>1902</h4>
<p>'The Tailor of Gloucester' published by Beatrix Potter.</p>
<h4>1904</h4>
<p>'The Tale of Two Bad Mice' published by Beatrix Potter.</p>
<h4>1910</h4>
<p>'The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse' published by Beatrix Potter.</p>
<h4>1918</h4>
<p>'The Tale Of Johnny Town-Mouse' published by Beatrix Potter (an adaptation of the Classical tale of 'Town Mouse and Country Mouse')</p>
<h4>1928</h4>
<p>'Steamboat Willie' released by Disney, featuring the first public appearance of Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse is inspired by Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks.</p>
<h4>1932</h4>
<p>Mickey Mouse Club reaches 1 million members.</p>
<h4>1935</h4>
<p>The first colour film of Mickey Mouse is released, 'The Band Concert', widely regarded as one of history's most popular pieces of animation.</p>
<p>Around this time, the following piece of Nazi propaganda appears in a German newspaper:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Mickey Mouse is the most miserable ideal ever revealed. Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal. Away with Jewish brutalization of the people! Down with Mickey Mouse! Wear the Swastika Cross!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Decades later, Art Spiegelman is inspired by this antisemitic sentiment to depict Jews as mice, in his graphic novel 'Maus'. The quote appears at the beginning of the second volume.</p>
<h4>1939</h4>
<p>Author Brian Jaques is born at the beginning of WW2. 47 years later, his wartime childhood becomes an inspiration for the Redwall series.</p>
<h4>1940</h4>
<p>'Puss Gets The Boot' or, the first Tom and Jerry cartoon, is made by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, released by MGM, and nominated for an Academy Award.</p>
<p>'Fantasia' is released by Disney, featuring the iconic Mickey Mouse sequence, 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'.</p>
<h4>1945</h4>
<p>'Stuart Little' published by EB White, and illustrated by Garth Williams.</p>
<h4>1958</h4>
<p>'Pixie and Dixie and Mr Jinks' airs as part of The Huckleberry Hound Show, made by Hanna-Barbera for MGM.</p>
<h4>1959</h4>
<p>'The Rescuers' book published by English author Margery Sharp. These continue to be published up to 1978. It is also illustrated by Garth Williams, who had previously illustrated 'Stuart Little'. Shortly after publication of 'The Rescuers', the film adaptation begins development.</p>
<h4>1962</h4>
<p>Scientist Bob Calhoun <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-doomed-mouse-utopia-that-inspired-the-rats-of-nimh">publishes research into overcrowding</a>, based on experiments on rats and mice. Calhoun's language when describing the mice is very anthropomorphic, and he seemed to believe the mice were highly comparable with humans.</p>
<p>An author called Robert C. O'Brien visits Calhoun's lab at The National Institute For Mental Health while it is in use, and the work becomes one of the influences for O'Brien's book, 'Mrs Frisby and The Rats of Nimh', which is later adapted into a film.</p>
<h4>1966</h4>
<p>'Flowers For Algernon' is published in novel form by Daniel Keyes.</p>
<h4>1971</h4>
<p>'Mrs Frisby and The Rats of Nimh' published by Robert C. O'Brien, and goes on to win 6 major literary awards over the next decade.</p>
<p>Don Bluth starts as a trainee animator at Disney.</p>
<h4>1972</h4>
<p>Art Spiegelman produces the first rough comic strip iteration of what would later become 'Maus'.</p>
<h4>1977</h4>
<p>'The Rescuers’, is released by Disney. (Don Bluth is promoted to a lead animator to steer the film.)</p>
<h4>1979</h4>
<p>Following creative differences on the production of Disney's 'The Black Cauldron' and 'The Fox and the Hound', and internal politics around the treatment of animators, and Bluth's objections to Disney's budget cuts affecting animation quality, Don Bluth leaves Disney to establish the animation house 'Don Bluth Entertainment'.</p>
<h4>1981</h4>
<p>'Danger Mouse' is released on ITV. It is created by Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall, and is inspired by 1960s TV show 'Danger Man', and James Bond. Having a mouse main character gives the animation team space to be silly and experimental. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111003214234/http://danger-mouse.net/cosgrove.html">(source)</a></p>
<h4>1982</h4>
<p>'The Secret of Nimh' released by Don Bluth Entertainment, the company's first feature-length film. The film included many experimental and expensive animation techniques, in comparison to Disney's low budget methods they were using at this time.</p>
<h4>1983</h4>
<p>The Observer publishes an article noting that mouse fanciers have a long history in the uk, particularly among Yorkshire miners, in industrial Manchester and in the East End of London. Bradford is described by one mouse fancier as 'the mecca'. <a href="https://thenationalmouseclub.co.uk/mice-matter/">(source)</a></p>
<h4>1986</h4>
<p>Brian Jaques publishes the first 'Redwall' book, inspired by his childhood, growing up during WW2, and his memories of the RAF and the dockworkers in Liverpool. Jaques says: <em>&quot;Mice are my heroes because, like children, mice are little and have to learn to be courageous and use their wits.&quot;</em> <a href="http://www.redwall.org/ideas.html">(source)</a></p>
<p>'The Great Mouse Detective' is released by Disney.</p>
<p>'An American Tail' is released by Don Bluth Entertainment. Don Bluth suggests the main character should have an American name but Steven Spielberg names him after his Jewish grandfather, Fievel.</p>
<p>Despite dodging union laws (and by 'dodging' I mean: Bluth moved the whole studio to Ireland to evade animation union laws) 'An American Tail' is a huge success. On an $9mil budget, the film makes $84mil at box office, and becomes the highest-grossing non-Disney film at the time, and beating Disney's own mouse film of that year at box office takings (which only made $38.7mil.)</p>
<p>The first volume of 'Maus' by Art Spiegelman is published by Pantheon Books. This is a graphic novel based on Spiegelman's father's real-life experiences as a holocaust survivor. Spiegelman believes that his former classmate, Don Bluth, plagiarised his idea of depicting persecuted Jews as mice, but never presses charges. <a href="https://ew.com/article/1991/12/13/art-spiegelman-produces-best-seller/">(source)</a></p>
<h4>1987</h4>
<p>'The Mighty Mouse' TV series premieres on CBS.</p>
<h4>1989</h4>
<p>'The Tailor of Gloucester' adapted for ITV as a Christmas special.</p>
<h4>1990</h4>
<p>'The Rescuers Down Under' released by Disney.</p>
<h4>1991</h4>
<p>'Fievel Goes West' released by Amblimation (Bluth no longer attached.).</p>
<p>Art Spiegelman publishes the second volume of 'Maus' (A bit bizarre that both of his novels managed to be published the same years as the two most successful 'American Tail' films, which he of course hated.)</p>
<h4>1992</h4>
<p>'The World Of Peter Rabbit and Friends' TV series premieres on BBC, featuring several of the tales with mice.</p>
<p>'Maus' by Art Spiegelman becomes the first graphic novel to win a Pulitzer.</p>
<h4>1999</h4>
<p>'Redwall' TV series premieres.</p>
<p>'Stuart Little' film released by Columbia Pictures.</p>
<h4>2024</h4>
<p>Mickey Mouse enters public domain.</p>
