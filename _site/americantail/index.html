    <h1>My thoughts on An American Tail</h1>

    <p>I really enjoyed this film. At the time I watched it, 'The Rescuers' was my favourite mouse film, but this one pushed past it. I love the light and shade in the film, and that it isn't afraid to get gritty, like showing a pogrom in direct comparison to the mice being hunted by cats, and the detail of Bridget's parents being killed by cats.</p>
<p>For me, the most memorable shot of the film is where Fievel is curled up, alone on 'Orphan Row' or whatever the name of the street is, surrounded by other lost mouse children, and the camera zooms out to show how many there are, and then <em>keeps</em> zooming out, more and more. Just fucking brutal.</p>
<p>I also think 8-year-old Phillip Glasser does such an incredible job providing the voice of Fievel. I was basically in tears at the end when Fievel hears his father's violin and whispers 'Papa?'. He was apparently picked from hundreds of cassette tapes of voices. <a href="https://boundingintocomics.com/movies/animation-legend-don-bluth-and-phillip-glasser-voice-of-fievel-in-an-american-tail-go-west-to-feel-nostalgic-at-fan-expo-2025">(source)</a></p>
