    <h1>Text Adventures</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Date Created: </b>26 Jun 2024</p>
    <p>I make interactive text adventures in <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/inklewriter/">Inklewriter</a> and in previous years, <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>. Twine was one of my first introductions to programming. When I was a teenager, Twine was also the first platform where I learned trans people existed, as two of my favourite Twine authors were trans, and this came up as a topic throughout their games and writing.</p>
<p>I love interactive text because it's such a quick way to get game ideas up and running. It was so cool to learn that Charlie Brooker used <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/black-mirror-bandersnatch-interactive-episode/">a hacked version of</a> Twine, Scrivener, Notepad, and Final Draft to develop 'Bandersnatch', the interactive Black Mirror special. I didn't think much of the plot of Bandersnatch, to be honest, but I remember the use of form was creative and fun.</p>
<p>I haven't written a text game in a long time, and I would love to again, but I can't figure out what topic to do it on. I have been quite interested in Ultra Processed Foods recently, and I wanted to write a play about it, but the topic is so sprawling that I wasn't sure where to start. Perhaps a game is a better way into this topic, as I don't have to be so linear.</p>
