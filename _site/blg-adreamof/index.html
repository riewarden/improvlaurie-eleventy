    <h1>A dream for an arts industry outside proprietary software</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>11 Feb 2025</p>
    <p>Here are a few dreams I have about how the future arts industry could function in the future if everyone moved away from Microsoft and Google (And maybe even Windows).</p>
<h2>Company data is stored on the cloud, but by an administrator who lives down the road from you, using open-source software.</h2>
<p>She is paid by several public funding streams to ensure the longevity and data security of small arts businesses, and works to a set of national/international standards for data security and standards of service. If something goes wrong with your server, you can call her or one of her colleagues on your phone, within an hour and ask directly what's wrong, rather than sending an email to an endless void and getting an AI response 3 months later.</p>
<p>If you need an extra cloud-supported feature, like videoconferencing, surveys, an accessibility improvement for your disability, a wiki, a shared task list, a shared budget manager, hours tracker, etc. Your administrator can research it for you, and ask other businesses in the network if they would also benefit from the adaptation. If the thing you need is very bespoke, like perhaps a multimedia app that is part of an interactive theatre piece you are directing, your administrator could even reach out to a developer, who could develop an entirely new app that fits into the existing architecture of your cloud.</p>
<p>She keeps multiple off-site backups of your data, and will show you how to make your own backups, for added security and peace of mind. If there is a security vulnerability in the cloud software, it is spotted quickly by a community of open-source developers, many of whom are also artists, who have a vested interest in spotting vulnerabilities because they too use the server architecture to support their own businesses. If you decide you don't like the way your administrator stores data, or feel you don't get enough support, you could organise with local artists to lobby the administrator and their public funders to change way they do things, and if you're still not happy, there is another provider a few miles away (possibly in a different catchment) offering a different, but still publicly funded service.</p>
<h2>You never have to pay to edit documents ever again.</h2>
<p>PDF becomes the standard for sending non-collaborative documents over email and compatibility issues between proprietary and Libre editing packages diminish significantly. You never have to deal with opening a piece of software to see the entire layout has changed without your consent, along with an AI helper in the corner of the screen that you didn't ask for. You never have to look at a budget sheet and choose between 'software subscription' and something you actually need, ever again.</p>
<p>You get a new computer, and don't have to completely overhaul your workflow, on top of everything other infuriating thing you have to do that year. You can just go on using the same software, because it's funded by a non-profit who have no financial investment in tying you down to one platform. You can even buy a machine that is old, to save money and avoid further damaging finite natural resouces, and everything still runs fine with backwards compatibility, and no bloated, over-engineered features hogging the RAM, cloud, and hard disk space.</p>
<h2>Running tech for a show suddenly has options.</h2>
<p>Sure, most people still use the big one, but for everyone else, particularly beginner artists still learning their craft while trying to cover rent, or touring artists on a small scale, who have to run tech as well as 50 other things, there is a free, non-profit, cross-platform, open-source alternative that is gradually gaining ground. It makes complete sense, given that most live production has been run on open protocols for decades. It took a long time, but growing interest in a theatre-centred tool, with lots of input from non-technical theatremakers, to make it as accessible as possible, has given birth to a true opponent in the technical design and operation sphere.</p>
<h2>These are just a few ideas.</h2>
<p>When I talk about open source to arts professionals, I am literally treated like I am an idiot. I am treated as though I am too stupid to understand why Microsoft is a gigantic company, and I am treated as though I am difficult and whingey for not wanting to use products that destroy the environment and erode privacy rights for billions of people.</p>
<p>Many people in the tech industry have already lived in this future that I am talking about for decades. This future is what is demanded by millions of open-source users, on a daily basis, and has been demanded since the birth of the Free Software movement in the 1970s. The arts is strangled by proprietary software, when among us are the people who most direly need to be liberated from it.</p>
<p>Many artists I speak to seem to think technology is some far-away concern for other people to worry about, while they get on with 'actual art'. Some even act insulted when I ask them to think critically about how they use technology and the politics of each software package, the physical reality of the cloud servers they use thousands of miles away, and their implications for the climate, and information security.</p>
<p>The arts will never change its toxic relationship to proprietary technology unless we stand up and make the choice to leave. I dream of an open-source arts industry. I'm not claiming to be there yet, but I've comitted myself to open-sourcing my relationship with technology, within my artistic practice.</p>
