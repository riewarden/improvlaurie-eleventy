    <h1>How to see more good theatre</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>23 Jan 2025</p>
    <p>You open a theatre brochure, and flip through the pages, each showing a different production coming up this year. <em>This one looks like Shakespeare. The next one looks like a serious-looking European company, with cool photos. There's a show with puppets, that's probably for kids, oh, maybe it isn't? Then, there's a two page spread with a massive photo of some elderly actor who seems as though he's supposed to be famous, but you've got no clue who he is. Finally, something that looks like a goth musical, and it's won loads of awards from somewhere.</em> All of the shows have glossy photos and intriguing fonts, but you've got no clue which of these shows is actually worth seeing, and the tickets are HOW MUCH???</p>
<p>Theatre people are always banging on about <em>'Why don't more people go to the theatre? the theatre's so great!'</em> In my opinion, I think part of the problem is that a lot of people <strong>would</strong> go to the theatre, but, especially if you didn't grow up going to the theatre, it's hard to make an informed choice about what is worth the hassle of going. And other entertainment options like TV, films and videogames are <strong>less effort, less money, and less risk</strong>. Theatre tickets can be very expensive, and it's hard to justify booking to see something, as well as organising transport, accommodation, food, babysitters, moving work shifts around, etc. if you don't know if it will be worth it.</p>
<p>This short guide aims to help you make sense of your local theatre's season programme and choose something you might actually enjoy. I've summarised <strong>three ways you can background-check a production</strong>, and make an informed decision. You could do one of these background checks, or all three. I usually only do number 1, number 2 if I'm really not sure, and avoid number 3 unless I really need the extra security that it's not going to be completely terrible.</p>
<p>Researching a show beforehand might seem like a lot of work, but for every play you look up, and then end up seeing, you gain more knowledge about your taste in theatre. Your ability to assess what you will enjoy, and what will challenge you will become easier over time. You'll start to recognise the names of playwrights, directors, companies, designers, etc., and be able to make quicker judgements when initially skimming through a programme.</p>
<h2>1 - Choose a play, and see if there is existing information online</h2>
<p>While there is a place for new writing in many theatres, mostly, plays are not new, and it is quite easy to find out information about their plots. Start from the brochure, or the theatre's website, and see what sparks your interest. <strong>If you like the sound of something, see what else you can find out about it from other sources</strong>. There might be a Wikipedia entry for the play, (with academic resources at the bottom) or, the play might be adapted from something else like a book, a film, a historical event, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes, plays have movie-like trailers that the theatre companies release on social media to help audiences get a feel for their production. Your library may have a copy of the play that you can read, and if it's a classic play, it may have study guides, aimed at students.</p>
<p>If the text is written by a long-dead author, it can be useful to learn a bit about why and when they wrote the play, and what the play may have meant to audiences in the author's own time. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why is this play being done now?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is the text the same, or has it been changed?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Might it say something today that is still relevant?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in the answer to these questions, <strong>it's probably a play worth seeing</strong>. You will probably get something out of the experience, even if you don't agree with all of the director's choices.</p>
<h2>2 - Look up previous work by the lead creatives.</h2>
<p>On the production's webpage, there will be information about the company who are staging the show, and the names of the people in the cast and creative team. <strong>Looking up the previous work of some of these creatives may give you an idea of what this production will look like</strong>, as well as the company's politics, and their style of working with text, movement, design, etc. Many companies have websites, YouTube channels and social media where you can watch clips and interviews with the cast and creatives, and their previous productions.</p>
<p>In productions with long lists of confusing credits, the people you may want to focus on are people credited as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Director</strong> (Usually approves all creative decisions from the rest of the team)</li>
<li><strong>Choreographer/Movement Director</strong> (You don't just get them in dance shows now)</li>
<li><strong>Production Design</strong> (not Producer) a.k.a <strong>Scenographer/Designer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also productions that rely heavily on the expertise of their <strong>Sound</strong>, <strong>Lighting</strong>, <strong>Set</strong>, <strong>Costume</strong> and <strong>Props Designers</strong>, and this may be more obvious if you can see photos or find reviews of the show. If music is important to the show, then you may want to look up the <strong>Composer</strong> and the <strong>Lyricist</strong> (who is sometimes credited for 'Libretto'). In many companies however, these named roles are not clearly delineated, and everyone in the company may be collectively responsible for various aspects of the production.</p>
<p>If you like the look of previous work done by members of the company, and the values they uphold as creatives, <strong>there's a good chance you will like another of their productions</strong>.</p>
<h2>3 - Read reviews.</h2>
<p>I view reading reviews as a last resort, as it's the check which I believe is <strong>most likely to heavily influence your final decision about whether to see or not see the production, based on the least amount of factual information</strong>. Reviewers often write with a level of certainty about what they have seen that can make it hard to gauge what another member of the audience may have thought. If you need to give yourself the best chance of not seeing something that's absolutely awful, checking the reviews can be a way to give yourself an extra feeling of security.</p>
<p>It is, however, still just a <strong>chance</strong>, and a feeling.  A reviewer might give a play a bad review simply because their publication editor required them to review it, and it's a play they would never have seen voluntarily. A lot of big-name British reviewers are middle-class, middle-aged white people, and they might not reliably recommend plays that align with your values and interests. <strong>A reviewer may misunderstand a directorial choice as incompetence, simply because they weren't the target audience that the choice was aimed at.</strong></p>
<p>Reviews can actually make it harder to decide whether or not to see a production, so I recommend reading them mindfully. Consider even finding reviews for a previous show that the lead creatives were involved in.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this has served as a useful guide for making sense of a season programme for your local theatre, so that you can actually see something interesting and enjoyable without worrying too much about wasting money. That being said, <strong>I don't think it's a good idea to only go and see theatre that you're sure you will like</strong>. Endless researching can get in your way of actually leaving the house and seeing anything. Sometimes you just have to take a chance, and give yourself permission to leave at the interval! <strong>We have to take a chance on something that ends up being garbage, so that we also give ourselves the chance to see something that ends up blowing our minds.</strong></p>
