<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>Hey there, and thanks for your help. Please adhere to the <a href="https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a> (be a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mensch">mentsch</a>).</p>
<p>There are a couple ways to get started. You can submit <a href="#bugs">bug reports</a> or <a href="#feature-requests">feature requests</a>, or work on existing bugs/features by <a href="#claiming-an-issue">claiming an issue</a>. If you have more general questions, open a new <a href="https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/discussions">discussion</a>.</p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>If you noticed a bug, please <a href="https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/issues/new/choose">submit a bug report</a> so someone can fix it. Include as much information as you think <em>might</em> be helpful (eg. screenshots, browser version, related issues). Remember that GitHub doesn't limit the number of characters, so you can add whatever you think is necessary.</p>
<p>Make sure that you can recreate the bug in a fresh repository, or it'll be hard to help you. If you can, create and link to a GitHub repository that maintainers can use to debug your issue.</p>
<h2>Feature Requests</h2>
<p>When there's something you want added, check <a href="https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/issues">the issues log</a>. If there's already an issue, but it's inactive, give it a nudge by commenting. Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/issues/new/choose">open a new issue</a> explaining <em>what</em> you want addded/changed and <em>why</em> it's important to you. Think about both the solution, and why that solution is necessary.</p>
<h2>Claiming an Issue</h2>
<p>Browse through <a href="https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden/issues">open issues</a>. Once you've found one that you like, go ahead and leave a comment saying you're working on the issue. You can comment to ask for help as well.</p>
<p>When you're finished, open a pull request. Every pull request should correspond to an open issue (except for typos). Even if you already made the changes, you can create a <em>draft</em> pull request instead, and open an issue.</p>
