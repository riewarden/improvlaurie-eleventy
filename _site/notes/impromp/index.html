    <h1>Impromptunes! Improvisational Piano Tutorials</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Date Created: </b>29 Jun 2024</p>
    <p>Impromptunes was a web app that I wrote with Twee (Twine) as a project for The Leeds Piano Trail, which was a festival that ran alongside Leeds International Piano Competition in 2021. A core feature of the festival was an installation where we placed 12 pianos around Leeds City Center, decorated by local artists and community groups.</p>
<p>My task was to create a series of interactive activities that people could access on their phones, and which would encourage them to play the pianos. I researched and wrote tutorials for each piano, that were inspired by the piano's surroundings, and which used techniques from Jazz, Blues, and Modern/Experimental (Think the 'John Cage' bit of music history) composition methods, to encourage participants to play and improvise on the piano in front of them. I would do it a bit differently today, but I am still really proud of what I created!</p>
