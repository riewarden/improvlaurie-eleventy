    <p>Sometimes when I get stressed, I start coding. Coding can be frustrating of course, but I often find myself in a state where I am reading about the cool, logical construction and progression of commands, to be typed into a terminal, or fed from a script, and my brain feels relaxed and quiet.

I return over and over to <a href="/notes/textadvs/">interactive text as a creative practice</a></p>
