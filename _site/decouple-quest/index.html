    <h1>Trying to decouple myself from proprietary software</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>23 Jan 2025</p>
    <p>A log of my progress moving away from software that requires me to rent services from companies.</p>
<h2>Completed</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>My Website</strong> <em>23/01/25</em> I regard this as completed, because I have no real desire to ever host my domain locally. I have, however, moved the actual design and maintenance of my website from Wix to 11ty, served by Netlify. It's a lot more hassle but I would never go back (at this point).</li>
</ul>
<h2>In Progress</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Storage</strong> <em>23/01/25</em> In the past few months, I've been trying out NextCloud, using a free account, provided by a company. I've been trying to use it more lately but its AutoUpload is a little bit unreliable. Everything syncs, just usually within an hour rather than seconds, which is annoying but not critically damaging. I have pretty much stopped using Google Photo to back up photos from my phone, which feels like a win. I haven't tested how good it is at collaborative editing. I'm sure it could be better if I self-hosted, but I'm not in a position to do that yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Media Center</strong> <em>23/01/25</em> This week, I've started using Plex to organise films and TV, and I really like it so far. I don't have a way to serve to my phone remotely, but it's just nice to finally be able to organise all my random videos. I have several DVDs of acting masterclasses and recordings of plays, which are a faff to get out during classes to show as examples. This system will hopefully make it much easier to access what I need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nowhere Near/Aspirations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Editing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Surveys</strong></li>
<li><strong>Videoconferencing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Music Streaming</strong></li>
</ul>
