    <h1>Food Industry</h1>
    <p>
        <p class="lsup"><b>Last Modified: </b>11 Dec 2024</p>
    <p>I think about food and the culture around it a lot. In 2024 I became interested in <a href="/upfs">Ultra Processed Foods.</a></p>
<p>The thoughts that I have relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who can't afford to make food from scratch are shamed for it (afford: time, money, energy)</li>
<li>That some people get to have the real food and other people settle for the repreesntation of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13670278">The Chorleywood Method</a> has deeply obfuscated what people think 'real bread' is.</li>
<li>How many people would stop buying Coca-Cola if we showed them how to make their own fizzy drinks at home, using <a href="https://brewbuch.com/how-to-make-kombucha/">kombucha</a> and <a href="https://www.fermentingforfoodies.com/catching-ginger-bug/">ginger bugs</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, I've written a poem called <a href="/poemlabrador">Labrador</a>, which expresses some of my feelings about processed food. But to be honest, it's such a huge area that feels so inflammatory, and I'm never sure where to start making creative things from it. I feel awkward talking about Chorleywood because nearly everyone has a loaf of Chorleywood in their kitchen. And it becomes yet another thing for people to feel they're supposed to be guilty about.</p>
