- [Simple flatbreads](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/no-yeast-pizza-dough)
    - These make great pizza bases.
- [Cheat's Spinach Lasagne](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/spinach-lasagna-recipe/)
  - Incredible but very simple lasagne where you don't have to make separate sauces, you just layer up passata, sausage meat, ricotta and spinach and pasta.
- [Pajeon](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/pajeon)
  - Super simple midweek meal. I like to make a cheaper version that replaces the seafood for lardons. But don't forget to put enough oil on to cook the pancake, the lardons don't create enough.
- [[recipecracker|Laurie's Rosemary and Garlic Crackers]]
  - So tasty.
- [How to use the seasoning triangle](https://youtu.be/mFzCV2wI6Jc?si=VcXND9Nnb7riUSsa) - This YouTube video is a practical demonstration of how the seasoning triangle works. The seasoning triangle is a concept that helps you to taste food, and understand what seasoning to add: salt, sweet, or acid.

   	- If you want to eat more salad, make tasty salad.
   	- Season everything! With a bit of salt and pepper.
   	- Don't be afraid to add more proteins if you don't feel full after eating it.
   	- If you roast veg in oil and herbs/spices, it creates its own sauce that can season the rest of the salad.
