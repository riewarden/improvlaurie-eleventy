title: Fermentation
---
I started learning to ferment at the beginning of 2024. I can't completely remember what drew me to the topic. I think I had been learning about making my own pickles and preserves, and also had been wondering how to make my own fizzy drinks without a soda stream. The more I learned about fermentation, the more it fascinated me.

Fermentation involves cultivating an ideal environment for specific types of bacteria and/or yeast that do not harm human health. The microorganisms are encouraged to monopolise a food product, and in doing so, they metabolise parts of the food to keep themselves alive. This changes the flavour of the food, but also preserves it, because the monopoly of safe bacteria (often in conjunction with lack of oxygen) prevents dangerous bacteria from thriving.

I have a recurring phase of hypochondria, where for periods of weeks or months, I get suddenly and intensely anxious about my health, and the dangers of pathogens or bacteria. When it's a very bad episode, I might eat a plate of fridge-cold leftovers that are two days old, and have a panic attack, imagining the leftovers have somehow been colonised with botulism, and I am seconds away from being paralysed and dying. Hypochondria would have me believe that all bacteria is dangerous, all the time, and always ready to kill me. This isn't true, however. Humans have intentionally cultivated certain types of bacteria on food, for thousands of years in some places. This fact is a challenge to the representation of reality portrayed by my hypochondria.

Learning to ferment forced me to learn about how micro-organisms work, and I am by no means an expert now, but I no longer see microorganisms as always dangerous and unpredictable. Some of them are my friends, and some of them are not, and understanding the environment that each is drawn to is the most important part.
