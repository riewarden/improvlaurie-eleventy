title: Fermentation, my story
---
I started learning to ferment at the beginning of 2024. I can't completely remember what drew me to the topic. I think I had been learning about making my own pickles and preserves, and also had been wondering how to make my own fizzy drinks without a soda stream. The more I learned about [[fermentwhatis|fermentation]], the more it fascinated me.

I have a recurring phase of [[hypochondriawhatis|hypochondria]], where for periods of weeks or months, I get suddenly and [[exhyper|intensely anxious]] about my health, and the dangers of pathogens or bacteria. Hypochondria would have me believe that all bacteria is dangerous, all the time, and always ready to kill me. This isn't true, however. Humans have intentionally cultivated certain types of bacteria on food, for thousands of years in some places. This fact is a challenge to the representation of reality portrayed by my hypochondria.

Learning to ferment encouraged me to learn about how micro-organisms work, and I am by no means an expert now, but I no longer see microorganisms as always dangerous and unpredictable. Some of them are my friends, and some of them are not, and understanding the environment that each is drawn to is the most important part.
