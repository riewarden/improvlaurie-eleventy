People often ask me how to get involved with theatre in Nottingham, and I hope this page gives you some ideas. This page is aimed at non-professionals, and emphasises amateur-friendly groups and learning.

## Beginner Pathways
### I want to perform and I like learning lines!
You should probably look for a theatre group to join. Luckily, Nottingham is full of them.
  - **To get stuck in,** find some theatres near you, using the lists at the bottom of the page. Look at their websites, follow them on socials or sign up to their mailing list and look out for auditions, socials, or open days.
  - [The Actors Workshop](https://www.theactorsworkshopnottingham.com/) is a great place to do affordable short courses in acting. 

### I want to perform but I don't like learning lines!
You should try improv! This is a type of theatre where you make it up as you go along.
  - [Making It Up](https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/project/making-it-up/) is a weekly improv group for beginners at Nottingham Playhouse.
  - [MissImp](https://www.missimp.co.uk/) are an improv company who run weekly drop-ins, courses, and shows.
  - [Loose Goose](https://loose-goose-improv.mailchimpsites.com/) is a bi-monthly relaxed improv jam on Tuesday nights.
  
### I want to be backstage.
  - [Join Lace Market Theatre,](https://lacemarkettheatre.co.uk/) and on sign-up, express interest in helping backstage, and operating tech. This is a great way to meet experienced crew, and learn the ropes. You can do the same with any amateur group, but LMT has the advantage of owning their own auditorium and costume store.
  - [Theatre Crafts Books List](https://archive.org/details/@riewarden/lists/2/theatre-crafts) This is a list of free online Internet Archive books about building things for theatre.
  
### I want to write (or just read) plays.
  - **Join a play reading group** to meet other people interested in text for stage.
    - [Encore Performing Arts](https://www.facebook.com/encorenottingham) have started running a play reading group, advertised on Facebook.
    - [Outspoken Acts](https://www.theprideshop.co.uk/contact-us/) is an LGBTQIA+ play reading group. They don't have an online presence, so if you want to get involved, the link goes to the 'Contact' page of their venue, The Pride Shop, who can pass your details on to the right person. Outspoken Acts have a WhatsApp group and mailing list.
  - **Join a writer's group** or participate in writing workshops.
    - [Nottingham Playhouse Writer's Room](https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/for-artists/amplify/writers-group/)
    - [Nottingham Writer's Studio Events](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/cc/workshops-2613409)
    - [Writing East Midlands List of Groups](https://writingeastmidlands.co.uk/for-writers/writing-groups/writing-groups-nottinghamshire/)

## Theatres You Can Visit
- [Lace Market Theatre](https://lacemarkettheatre.co.uk/LaceMarketTheatre.dll/WhatsOn) Amateur theatre with a 100 year history, high production values, and their own auditorium.

NNT put on a variety of productions, emphasising UON students in the onstage and backstage teams, but which are open for anyone to watch.
