title: Revising and Gut Feelings
---
A lot of my writing and editing is done on instinct. That’s not to say I edit on a whim, but I do edit based on gut feeling 90% of the time, and the other 10% is ‘what is going to make this easier?’. I edit the script for [[SOM|Some Other Mirror]] the most when I am learning the words themselves because that’s the time when I really learn what feels authentic for me to say. It’s quite exciting when I learn, sometime years later, why I made an editorial choice. It keeps the text fresh and exciting for me.
