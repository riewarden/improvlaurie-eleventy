This is part 3 of a 3-part series on how I make props for Club Wormhole.

In this article, I explain how I draw plans for props, before I build them. I have only recently started doing this, and it seriously saves so much hassle.

## Drawing a plan 

### 2-Dimensional Props
If you want your prop to be 2D, you don't have to be very precise with 99% of your measurements. I do, however, recommend using a ruler to decide how big you need the whole prop to be, just to make your life easier. Knowing the maximum size of the prop will help you find the volume of materials that you need, and give you an indication of if you're going to need extra time to source these, e.g, you might have to spend an extra hour or two compositing some smaller pieces of cardboard to make some larger pieces. 

In my opinion, the three most important thing about prop size are:
- It's not so huge that you don't actually have time to make it.
- It can be seen and understood visually by someone at the back.
- It can be transported to the venue without being damaged.
### 3D props
I recommend making a drawing of all the pieces you need, and deciding on all the measurements, to save yourself time in the long run. If your measurements are complete guesswork, this can lead to your parts not joining together properly, which can be a total pain, especially if it happens late in the build when you're running out of time.
- If you're not sure if a design is going to work, or if you have no idea how to start making measurements, try making a tiny draft version of what you want (known as a maquette), cut freehand, don't worry too much about measurements, then, use a ruler to measure the maquette and either double or triple the figures to draw a plan for a big version.

I usually make a doodle, showing the rough shapes of everything, as it should look when it is cut out. Each unique shape gets an identifying letter, and a key at the side explains the dimensions for each lettered shape. 

i.e, If I'm making a cube, all the sides are the same length, so I label them all A on the doodle, and mark at the side that I need: 'A' x 6, each 15cmx15cm. 

If I was making a long box shape, there would be be A and B shapes labelled, to help me remember which parts are the same length as each other, and how many of each that I need.
### Sustainable design
When designing, it's a good idea to also consider the following:
- **How easy is it to store this prop, and how long can it be stored for?** If you don't have a lot of transport capabilities, or storage space, is there a way for you to design the prop so it can be carried and stored easily? Perhaps, the delicate parts could be stored separately and then attached temporarily with kraft tape at the venue? Or, perhaps the prop has hinges which allow it to be folded away.
- **How easy is it to re-use or modify this prop?** If you're making a giant book, for example, is there a way to design it so that it could become different books, for different themes of show?
- **If the prop needs to be got rid of, can this be done ethically?** I make everything out of cardboard, glue, and kraft tape so that it can easily be dismantled and recycled, if needed. Club Wormhole does a new show every month, and it makes no sense to me to spend lots of money on wasteful materials that will end up in a landfill.
- **How robust does the prop need to be?** Do you want to be able to reuse the prop for another show? How likely is it that the prop will be manhandled, dropped, accidentally trodden on, have a drink spilled on it, etc? Are there moving parts that need to withstand being held, pushed, pulled, used to hit things, etc? On the other hand, you might actually want a prop that is easy to break. Do you want the prop to be destroyed at some point in the show? How easy will it be for a performer to do this? 

The answers to these questions may impact the materials you choose, and how you join them together (which I go over in more detail in the next article).
