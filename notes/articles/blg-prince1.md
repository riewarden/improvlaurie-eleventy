This is the first of a series of blogs where I will talk about my experience of directing 'The Prince', by Abigail Thorn. My production was staged at Lace Market Theatre in July 2025. 

Doing this will be a useful reflection for myself as a director, and hopefully, will be interesting for fans of the play as well. These posts will be long, but that's because I spent a year working on this play, I have thought deeply about it for many hours, and have discovered I have a lot to say about it. 

These blogs are written with the assumption that you are familliar with 'The Prince', and have either read or seen the play at least once.

This first blog will focus on how I tackled the Shakespeare side of the play.

## Dealing with the Shakespeare

Just anecdotally, I believe there is a misconception about 'The Prince', where it may be believed that the Shakespearean text is just set dressing, and therefore, the audience doesn't need to understand it. I disagree with this notion, because, first of all, Shakespearean text takes up about 60% of the play, so you're seriously wasting the audience's time if you're not considering it, and, I think it's insulting to both the author and the audience to not do the Shakespeare properly. 

Second of all, I think it is essential for the audience to understand what is happening in the Shakespeare plot, in order to understand why Hotspur spends so much energy trying to stay in the closet. Hotspur has massive emotional stakes tying her down to the plot of 'Henry IV Part 1'. The threat of civil war, of a monarchless country, of her father's last will and testament. She is also concerned with the emotional and practical sides of her marriage to Kate, both maintaining their relationship, and the land, titles, and reputation that is connected to them both. 

If the audience can't follow Hotspur's concerns, then Hotspur's motivations for apparently wanting to stay trapped are not comprehensible. In addition to studying the Shakesperare carefully, I also gave my cast some learning resources about the events of 'Richard II', which is the name of the play and the real historical figure that precede 'Henry IV Part 1', and which informs the points of view for all of the characters in that play.

## Doing Shakespeare properly

Acting Shakespeare for the first time is a rite of passage for most actors, and figuring out one's personal approach can be incredibly daunting for those with less experience, or indeed, actors who are experienced, but don't have an academic background. We had a mix of experience levels in our cast, everything from first-time actors, to people who had been doing Shakespeare for over 50 years. To unify everyone, at least slightly, I reccomended that cast members with significant amounts of Shakespeare to speak should watch (at least a couple of episodes) of John Barton's 'Playing Shakespeare' series.

['Playing Shakespeare' can be found on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLboSQWmG70j_S2nWkRlncZYW49nLeFKWj) and was originally filmed in 1979. In each episode, the then-Artistic Director of The Royal Shakespeare Company, John Barton, explores a series of extracts from Shakespeare plays, with a group of actors who he has directed in previous RSC productions. When the series was made, a lot of the actors featured were either already famous, or, up-and-coming, such as Ian McKellan, Judi Dench, David Suchet, Ben Kingsley, Patrick Stewart, Donald Sinden, Peggy Ashcroft, and more. 

The series is dated, there's no question about it, but I think Playing Shakespeare is still the most accessible, and comprehensive, resource I know of for learning how to approach a Shakespeare text, as a performer. Watching the actors try out the same scene several times, and seeing a director interrogate the different choices that can be made is very instructive, and much more helpful for learning the craft of Shakespearean acting than the common actor's strategy of just reading the play and wishing it made sense. 

While it is a comprehensive methodology, I don't think it is necessary to just do everything Barton says. Indeed, in the series, he encourages the participating actors to debate with him, and openly disagree with him on occasion. I think even if you totally disagree with Barton's highly academic approach, in order to disagree, you must reckon with the complex methodology that he proposes. Articulating why you don't like his approach is still an exercise which is very helpful if you are completely new to Shakespeare, and taking the first steps to formulating your personal approach to acting it.

## Directing Shakespeare

I also found the series helpful for me, as a director, to help me diagnose what was wrong when a speech wasn't working for an actor. So often, just identifying and emphasising the antithesis in a speech, would immediately 'fix' it, and help the actor to convey it with much clearer meaning. 'Antithesis' is a technique used by an author. It describes when a speech talks about two things that are opposites to each other. 

In 'The Prince', Hotspur has a speech in Scene 1.6, lifted directly from Henry IV Part 1 (also 1.6 in Arden Shakespeare 1974), which has several great examples of Antithesis. Hotspur is talking with great frustration about meeting Hal on the field, following The Battle of Holmedon Hill. At one point she says, 

*"It made me mad to see him talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns, and drums and wounds."*

This is an antithesis. Hotspur describes Hal as a mincing, effeminate youth, in opposition to his surroundings, which is a bloody battlefield filled with hundreds of injured and dead soldiers.

## Abigail Thorn's editorial choices about using the original Shakespeare

I kept a copy of 'Henry IV Part 1' with me at rehearsals, and noted which parts of the text were Shakespeare and 'Fakespeare' (Shakespearean-style scenes written by Thorn which do not appear in the original), as well as parts of the text which rephrased, edited, or re-contextualised the original Shakespeare. I might not have caught all of them, but I'll give you one example of an editing choice that stood out to me. 

In Scene 1.7 of 'The Prince', Hal and King Henry have an argument. The stage directions specify that Hal keeps trying to speak, but the King just interrupts him, essentially speaking in a continuous monologue, until he leaves in frustration. After King Henry leaves, Hal goes on a rant in modern text, where he unloads all of his frustrations with his father. Obviously, the modern text is an addition by Thorn, but it isn't the only way that this scene has been transposed and edited in an interesting way, from the original text.

In the original text, (Scene 3.2, in the Arden Shakespeare 1974 version) the King doesn't talk over Hal in a continuous monologue, and there is a seemingly much more equal power balance between them. Both of them volley back and forth exchanging chunks of verse, in a more formal structure.

At the end of the scene, Hal essentially apologises to the King. In 'Henry IV Part 1', this apology is the first meaningful step Hal takes to realising his destiny. In 'The Prince', however, Hal does not apologise at the end of the exchange, he instead says nothing. 

You have to ask, in which version of the scene does Hal have more power? Is it the original, where he says just as much as his father? Or, is it the scene from The Prince, where he refuses to submit?

The editorialising doesn't end here. Following the argument, once Hal is alone, the audience gets his true thoughts, as a soliloquoy. His soliliquoy also references text from the original play, but from a different scene entirely. 

In 'Henry IV Part 1', there is a scene where Hal takes the mickey out of Hotspur, by doing an impression (2.4, Arden Shakespeare 1974) but this is performed to one of his friends at the pub, and it's much lighter in tone, and not nearly as long of a bit. It's more like a throwaway gag. 

Is there something to be said for the fact that Hal's silly little joke, told in the company of friends, is transplanted to a private moment of great pain in his character arc, in 'The Prince'? 

There are many interesting editorial choices like this throughout the text.

## Conclusion

This summarizes my thoughts on how I approached the blend of Shakespeare with modern text. I want to write more blogs on the casting of the show, the production design, and how I made directorial choices that are different to the Southwark playhouse production.
