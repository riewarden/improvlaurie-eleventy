## DRAFT!

Recently, I directed a production of Chris Bush's play with music, 'The Last Noel', at my local amateur theatre in Nottingham City Center: Lace Market Theatre. Everyone involved in the production (and the theatre more widely) was an unpaid volunteer, and we were given a total production budget of £450. 

I decided that I wanted to try staging one relaxed performance as part of the run. Lace Market Theatre had never done a relaxed performance before, but with the support of The Lasting Project, and the Artistic Director of the season, as well as many LMT volunteers, the relaxed performance was a great success. 

We had some great feedback from the groups we invited, and so I wanted to share my findings with any other amateur or small-scale theatremaker who is interested in doing a relaxed performance but doesn't know where to start.

## The Lasting Project

When you first start thinking about a relaxed performance, you should contact The Lasting Project. They are a non-profit who have staged many relaxed performances with Long Eaton Operatic Society. They gave me support and advice throughout the whole production process. 

I, as the director, met with one of their reps, Becky, early in my creative process, to discuss the show and ensure that a relaxed performance was feasible. I also invited the rep to my production meeting, so that she could hear from the technicians and backstage crew about their roles and responsibilities, and answer any questions.

TLP offered to do various services for us to support the performance, and we chose to pay them to design and deliver a touch tour, which was £60. They also shared examples of other materials they had used on other shows, so that we could make our own content (e.g informational emails, and a video tour of the theatre). Becky also briefed all the venue staff and the theatre company at the dress rehearsal, and on the day of the relaxed performance.

The Lasting Project requested that we mentioned them in the programme, to help get the word out about their work, and to let them ask for contributions to a donation bucket at the end of the show.

## Planning stages
So how do you appraise your script, and identify things that may need to be altered for a relaxed performance? Before auditions, go through the script and note down anything like the following:

- Loud noises
- Bright flashing lights/colours
- Surprises
- Anything that inspires high emotion.

Don't start by thinking 'oh no, I'll have to cut this'. The idea of a relaxed performance is to not censor difficult material, but to adapt how it is presented, for people who need more support to handle it.

Think about ways you could reduce the impact of problematic parts of the script without cutting them or changing the words (which you may not even be allowed to do, depending on the license of the play). For example, you could have an optional 'sensory story' booklet which is a pamplet that can be made available on box office that provides a breakdown of each scene in the show, and warns people about loud noises or anything that could be overstimulating.

Ask yourself: Is it possible to do the whole show with house lights up? If not, could you just take out lighting cues which are sudden, or, amend the lighting cue file so that there are lighting effects, but the auditorium is never in full darkness. 

You may want to talk to your technicians, and see what they think, or if they know of any shows where these problems were solved.

If trying to adapt the show changes it into something completely different than your original artistic intention, your show may not be adaptable for a relaxed performance, or, you may want to chat to The Lasting Project and see if they have any ideas. It may just be that you're overthinking it.

### Scope

You may not be able to accomodate every single disability at your venue. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't bother offering a relaxed performance, it just means that you should define what accomodations you can and can't make. 

For example, LMT is not wheelchair accessible, but, we can still offer a relaxed performance for disabled people who don't use a wheelchair. The performance could just be made suitable for autistic people, people with Tourettes/tics, people with dementia, people with learning disabilities, visually impaired people, d/Deaf people. 

The outcome is still an opportunity to welcome people into the theatre who would otherwise not come at all.

## Why I decided to try The Last Noel as a relaxed performance

I first decided to try doing The Last Noel as a relaxed performance, because from my first reading of the script, it was clear that there is no part of the plot that hinges on the audience witnessing loud noises, flashing lights, lots of shouting, or shocking moments as you might need for a horror or thriller, etc. so immediately, it came across as a show where the production itself would be uncomplicated to adapt. 

The simplicity of adapting the show itself was important to me, as LMT had never offered a relaxed performance. I knew there could be logistical challenges at the theatre for customer services, in staffing the performance with extra volunteers, and advertising the show effectively to audiences. Having a production that needed little adaptation meant that the overall to-do list was significantly shorter.

But I don't think a show needs to be 'simple' in order to be considered for a relaxed performance. It's worth keeping in mind that big-budget pantomimes often offer relaxed performances, so, even if your show is more visually and auditorially stimulating, there are probably still ways it can be adapted.

Additionally, I loved the storytelling and characterisation in the script, and in the standard performance, I wanted the show to come to life in the audience's imagination, and not through lighting and sound effects. The standard show had three lighting cues, and one quiet sound cue. We ended up not even needing to adapt these, because the lighting cues still kept the auditorium sufficiently illuminated, had anyone wanted to leave. 

The Last Noel does deal with some difficult emotions, and doesn't have the most upbeat ending, but I felt these aspects could be easily supported by a sensory synopsis. A sensory synopsis is a breakdown of every scene in the play, with notes that may be helpful for people with sensory/learning disabilities, or people who otherwise avoid surprises.

I based my sensory synopsis off one created by Disney for their production of 'The Lion King'. You can compare the two below:

- [The Lion King](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwzhqvxaz/image/upload/v1684313457/Titles/The%20Lion%20King%20%28Lyceum%29/DisneysTheLionKing_SensorySynopsis_May23.pdf)
- [The Last Noel](/assets/pdfs/TLN-sensory-synop.pdf)

Other things that drew me towards the idea of a relaxed performance: The Last Noel has a 1 hr 10 min running time, and my production took place in a small studio theatre where the seating was easy to reconfigure, and was easy to leave and re-enter. That immediately meant that the show was more accessible for people who get fatigued easily, or who struggle to sit still for long periods of time. 

Overall, very few changes were needed to make the performance 'relaxed'. But also, knowing from the start that I wanted to do a relaxed performance meant that I didn't accidentally introduce anything to the default show that was then difficult to adapt. 

This is why you should decide very early after you accept the role of director, whether or not to do a relaxed performances, and not a few weeks before you open!

## Ticketing
Co-ordinate with customer services and whoever manages the venue website, and find a way to ticket the show that works for everyone. We reduced ticketing on the relaxed performance to about half, to give the audience members in attendance more space to move around, and choose where they wanted to sit.

Crucially, you need to prevent people from accidentally booking a ticket to the relaxed performance, without realising what it is! 

For Last Noel, we didn't put the performance on general sale, and instead created a page that explained what the relaxed performance was, and asked people to contact box office to book, and let us know of any additional accomodations. This wasn't a perfect solution, as people could not book in advance, and we didn't have as good a record of their details when we needed to email additional information. We were partly restricted by the limitations of the theatre website, which pulls all its information for one show from one database entry, and provided limited capacity to customise pages outside of this design.

Afterwards, myself, customer services, and our web co-ordinator agreed that a better option for LMT to try would be to create a separate database entry, just for the relaxed performance, as though it was a different show. This would still distinguish the show from the standard show, but allow people to book in advance.

## Audience Information

We asked around, and Googled, and acquired the names of various local charities that supported local people with disabilities. The Lasting Project also invited people from their networks. 

We emailed groups with information about what accomodations to expect at the relaxed performance, and who it was aimed at. I also made a simple graphic on Canva with a summary of this information, which could be shared on social media by marketing, and members of the company.

A few days before the show, we sent out an email to everyone who had booked tickets, with extra info about what to expect, and timings for the evening (e.g we had a tour of the theatre, and a touch tour before the performance). 

We also shot a simple 1-min video on a phone, in one take, with one of our company introducing the theatre, and showing the key areas that the audience needed to know about, i.e the box office, the bar, and the playing space. 

## The night of the show
Here is how the night of our relaxed performance went:

**5:30pm** - Front of House arrive for a briefing with The Lasting Project

**6:00-6:30pm** - Tour of theatre, led by theatre volunteers, for a school group of SEND young people.

**6:30-7:00pm** - Touch tour led by The Lasting Project.

**7:15pm** - Show preset starts (This was a standard part of all performances of The Last Noel where our actors came into the playing space in character, before the start of the show and asked audience to help decorate the stage)

**7:30pm** - Show starts

**9:45pm** - Show ends
