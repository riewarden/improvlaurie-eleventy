People often ask me how to get involved with theatre in Nottingham, and I hope this page gives you some ideas. This page is aimed at non-professionals, and emphasises amateur-friendly groups and learning.

## Beginner Pathways
### I want to perform and I like learning lines!
You should probably look for a theatre group to join. Luckily, Nottingham is full of them.
  - **To get stuck in,** find some theatres near you, using the lists at the bottom of the page. Look at their websites, follow them on socials or sign up to their mailing list and look out for auditions, socials, or open days.
  - [The Actors Workshop](https://www.theactorsworkshopnottingham.com/) is a great place to do affordable short courses in acting. 

### I want to perform but I don't like learning lines!
You should try improv! This is a type of theatre where you make it up as you go along.
  - [Making It Up](https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/project/making-it-up/) is a weekly improv group for beginners at Nottingham Playhouse.
  - [MissImp](https://www.missimp.co.uk/) are an improv company who run weekly drop-ins, courses, and shows.
  - [Loose Goose](https://loose-goose-improv.mailchimpsites.com/) is a bi-weekly relaxed improv jam on Tuesday nights.
  
### I want to be backstage.
  - [Join Lace Market Theatre,](https://lacemarkettheatre.co.uk/) and on sign-up, express interest in helping backstage, and operating tech. This is a great way to meet experienced crew, and learn the ropes. You can do the same with any amateur group, but LMT has the advantage of owning their own auditorium and costume store.
  
### I want to write.
  - **Join a play reading group** to meet other people interested in text for stage.
    - [Encore Performing Arts](https://www.facebook.com/encorenottingham) Have started running a play reading group, advertised on Facebook.
  - **Join a writer's group** or participate in writing workshops.
