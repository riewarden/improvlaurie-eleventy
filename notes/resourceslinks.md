## Videos
- [Sparkling Dialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vRfNtvFVRo&t=886s&pp=ygUec3BhcmtsaW5nIGRpYWxvZ3VlIGpvaG4gaW5nb2xk) - YouTube video of a narrative design talk by Jon Ingold, the developer of Inklewriter. about why most videogames have awful dialogue in comparison to films, but also why this is absolutely no excuse for awful dialogue in videogames. The live demonstration where he redrafts a key scene from Blade Runner, turning it from screenplay to choice-driven narrative in a few minutes, is nothing short of remarkable.
- [Stage manager calls cues for 'Hairspray'](https://youtu.be/5TXBqdDAXgE?si=H7Hq4dqmb5RIWvsq) - Youtube video. I was shown this at uni as a practical demonstration of what a Deputy Stage Manager does on a complicated show with lots of tech cues. A really cool watch if you want to learn more about what happens backstage at a theatre.
- [AD/BC: A Rock Opera (HD)](https://youtu.be/MO3UaI3T6xc?si=NZkPncr0h7UQiLnb) - Essential Christmas viewing. A highly specific but incredible parody of early Andrew Lloyd-Webber straight-to-tv musicals, starring Matt Berry, Julian Barratt and Julia Davis. This HQ version annoyingly doesn't come up as the first result on YouTube, so I have linked it here for your convenience!
- [Skyrim's Top 5 Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVdTZhmsGsU&pp=ygUmYnJpYW4gZGF2aWQgZ2lsYmVydCBza3lyaW0gYm9vayByZXBvcnQ%3D) - The only pointless video essay worth watching. Possibly my favorite YouTube video despite the fact I have never really played Skyrim.
