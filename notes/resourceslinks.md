## Videos
- [Sparkling Dialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vRfNtvFVRo&t=886s&pp=ygUec3BhcmtsaW5nIGRpYWxvZ3VlIGpvaG4gaW5nb2xk) - YouTube video of a narrative design talk by Jon Ingold, the developer of Inklewriter. about why most videogames have awful dialogue in comparison to films, but also why this is absolutely no excuse for awful dialogue in videogames. The live demonstration where he redrafts a key scene from Blade Runner, turning it from linear screenplay to non-linear choice-driven narrative in a few minutes, is nothing short of remarkable.
- [Stage manager calls cues for 'Hairspray'](https://youtu.be/5TXBqdDAXgE?si=H7Hq4dqmb5RIWvsq) - Youtube video. I was shown this at uni as a practical demonstration of what a Deputy Stage Manager does on a complicated show with lots of tech cues. A really cool watch if you want to learn more about what happens backstage at a theatre.
- [AD/BC: A Rock Opera (HD)](https://youtu.be/MO3UaI3T6xc?si=NZkPncr0h7UQiLnb) - Essential Christmas viewing. A highly specific but incredible parody of early Andrew Lloyd-Webber straight-to-tv musicals, starring Matt Berry, Julian Barratt and Julia Davis. This HQ version annoyingly doesn't come up as the first result on YouTube, so I have linked it here for your convenience!
- [Skyrim's Top 5 Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVdTZhmsGsU&pp=ygUmYnJpYW4gZGF2aWQgZ2lsYmVydCBza3lyaW0gYm9vayByZXBvcnQ%3D) - The only pointless video essay worth watching. Possibly my favorite YouTube video despite the fact I have never really played Skyrim.

## Articles

Helped me feel a lot less bad about being a slow reader, and excited to read more stuff.

## Books
- [The Art of Gathering](https://www.priyaparker.com/book-art-of-gathering) - *By Priya Parker* - A book by a woman who started her career as a conflict resolution expert in warzones and politically polarised communities across the world, uniting people in peace and social progression who had previously wanted to kill each other. Parker applies this mindful and purposeful philosophy of creating connection to the whole field of events planning, and it's utter, utter genius. It's all about how to organise meetings between people, in any context, and have it genuinely mean something, change people, and also be fun and memorable.
- [The Frank Book](https://archive.org/details/the-frank-book/001.jpg) - *By Jim Woodring* - Incomprehensible graphic novel, illustrated by Jim Woodring, who seems to have some form of hallucinatory schizophrenia which motivated his creation of the Frank series, but who otherwise has a very normal life. As a person who has manic episodes, and does a lot of creative work based on gut insticts that are not always fun or palatable, I found this really comforting. ([Read more about Jim here.](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-cute-and-horrifying-world-of-jim-woodring))
- [Entertaining](https://archive.org/details/entertaining0000stew) - *By Martha Stewart* - Incomprehensible domestic housekeeping and hosting handbook, written by Martha Stewart, who seems to have some form of paranoid manic profile which leads to her calmly explaining how you may host an omelette party for 100 people, in a tone that suggests she believes this type of event is normal and to be expected. Mean jokes aside, this massive book is a formidable testament to this woman's encyclopaedic events management knowledge.
