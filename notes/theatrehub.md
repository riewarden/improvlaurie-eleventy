title: Theatre and Me
---
My theatre knowledge usually intertwines with my fascination with games and systems. I have played a lot of table-top roleplaying games, I write text adventures, and [[imp|improv]] is fundamental to how I work creatively. I'm just always interested in sites where characters and limitations create stories.
