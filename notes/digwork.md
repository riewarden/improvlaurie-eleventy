I have made a lot of digital things over the years, which are scattered across many accounts, but this is an attempt to cyrate and contextualise a number of them.
- [[impromp|Impromptunes!]] was an interactive web app made for Leeds International Piano Competition that taught newbies to improvise on the piano. Click through for more detail. 
- [Conversation With a Cis Guy](https://strawberie.itch.io/conversation-with-a-cis-guy) is an 18+ interactive text adventure about a trans man hooking up with a friend who knew him pre-transition.
- [clic bird to start](https://piratescarfy.itch.io/bird) is a silly web game that I made when I was 18, apparently while sat at a burrito establishment. I'm proud of this because I also made all the art and sound myself.
- [Dice and Cosy](https://www.youtube.com/live/MTFmt-7r25I?si=OX6aK2z_RqgKjG5X) was a TTRPG livestream that I produced during lockdown, with a different 1-page RPG and cast of comedians every episode.
