# Portfolio
This is a summary of projects that are most relevant to what I currently offer as a practitioner.
## Current Projects
### Trans Drama Ensemble
A series of monthly 2-hr workshops in which I teach a different topic from the world of theatre. 2024 sessions run from March to July, and cover: Voice, Movement, Props, Light, Verbatim.

More information on the Nottingham Playhouse event listing.
### Trans Voice Workshops
A series of free monthly 2-hr workshops in which I, and a trained Speech and Language Therapist (specialising in trans voice) teach the basics of altering the gender of one's voice. Half of the workshop covers physical vocal skills, and the other half is about building the confidence to speak in front of others.

Currently on hold until bookings for September onwards open.
### Some Other Mirror
A continuously developing solo show about transitioning, and shaping one's masculine identity, which started development as a Zoom theatre show, made for university coursework, and is currently a touring, in-the-round, live theatre show with multimedia and interactive elements.
