### Trans Voice Workshops
A series of free monthly 2-hr workshops in which I, and a trained Speech and Language Therapist (specialising in trans voice) teach the basics of altering the gender of one's voice. Half of the workshop covers physical vocal skills, and the other half is about building the confidence to speak in front of others.

### Some Other Mirror
A continuously developing solo show about transitioning, and shaping one's masculine identity, which started development as a Zoom theatre show, made for university coursework, and is currently a touring, in-the-round, live theatre show with multimedia and interactive elements.

## Past Projects
### Impromptunes! Improvisational Piano Tutorials
Impromptunes was a web app that I wrote with Twee (Twine) as a project for The Leeds Piano Trail, which was a festival that ran alongside Leeds International Piano Competition in 2021. A core feature of the festival was an installation where we placed 12 pianos around Leeds City Center, decorated by local artists and community groups. 

My task was to create a series of interactive activities that people could access on their phones, and which would encourage them to play the pianos. I researched and wrote tutorials for each piano, that were inspired by the piano's surroundings, and which used techniques from Jazz, Blues, and Modern/Experimental (Think the 'John Cage' bit of music history) composition methods, to encourage participants to play and improvise on the piano in front of them. I would do it a bit differently today, but I am still really proud of what I created!
