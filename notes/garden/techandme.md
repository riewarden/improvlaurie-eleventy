Sometimes when I get stressed, I start coding. Coding can be frustrating of course, but I often find myself in a state where I am reading about the cool, logical construction and progression of commands, to be typed into a terminal, or fed from a script, and my brain feels relaxed and quiet.

I also make interactive text adventures in Inklewriter and in previous years, Twine. Twine and Scratch (which I am so happy to see is still a thing) were my first introductions to programming. When I was a teenager, Twine was also the first platform where I learned trans people existed, as two of my favourite Twine authors were trans, and this came up as a topic throughout their games and writing.
