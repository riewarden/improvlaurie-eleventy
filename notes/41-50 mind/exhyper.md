title: Bad Hyperchondria

When it's a very bad episode, I might eat a plate of fridge-cold leftovers that are two days old, and have a panic attack, imagining the leftovers have somehow been colonised with botulism, and I am seconds away from being paralysed and dying. It's one way that stress presents itself for me, but there are [[dyingworries|other things that I worry about too.]]

Most of the time I am ok though, and I often find that [[fermentation|educating myself]] about bacteria that is safe to eat, helps a lot!
