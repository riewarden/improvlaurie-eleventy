"In the summer of 2025 I had the privilege of being part of the cast of the Lace Market Theatre’s production of The Prince, by Abigail Thorn, which was directed by Laurie Owen."

"It goes without saying any director worth his salt should as a basic requirement be thoroughly familiar with the play that he is directing. But this was a complex, many layered play, derived from Shakespeare and from Holinshed. And it became clear that Laurie had put a lot of effort into familiarising himself with those sources as well."

"And while it also goes without saying that any decent director will have a vision, or at least an overall picture, of what he hopes to achieve with his particular production, you could see how Laurie was taking the individual strengths (and weaknesses) of the members of his cast, and using these properties realise his vision. It is hard to define precisely, but somehow he gave each of us an inspiration not merely to act out our characters, but meld them into his overall vision, so that the whole was truly greater than the sum of the individual parts."

"Laurie was always ready to listen, very thoroughly.   What is on the face of it a very minor incident illustrates this: I was having some difficulty with one particular line, or rather one particular word within the line, and suggested to Laurie I might change that one word. His reply by email a day later was to examine the word I was having problems with, in the context of its original use by Shakespeare and, indeed, Holinshed, and to encourage me to persevere. So his answer wasn’t a quick dismissal of my concern nor an easy acquiescence, but a thorough consideration of the problem. I respected him even more for that."

"Laurie’s care for his actors is exemplified by the fact that on three occasions a rehearsal had finished pretty late, and Laurie released us without giving notes. And  each time we received very comprehensive written notes from him by email the following morning, over which he must have burned a considerable amount of midnight oil. I take this as indicating not only Laurie’s dedication to the task but also his genuine concern for his cast."

"I’ve had a great variety of roles during my amateur acting career, and will always be grateful to Laurie giving me this dual role in The Prince which has been one of the most satisfying of all. And I owe this in large measure to artistry and maturity of a director who is probably young enough to be my grandson."
