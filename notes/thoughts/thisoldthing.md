*30th November 2024*

**This Old Thing** was a participatory workshop where I invited people to talk about their clothes, and what they mean to them. I facilitated the discussion using a list of questions designed to help participants think about the clothes they were wearing that day, and how they related to class, culture, personal history, aspirations, gender, etc. I transcribed and summarised what was said as text balloons, connected with lines. I added colour afterwards to show which questions had prompted certain sections of discussion.
I was inspired to create the workshop both to challenge myself to attempt to create a ‘graphic recording’, of a discussion, and to explore how I can use my artistic skills to interpret and represent the thoughts and feelings of others. Some of my favourite quotes were: 
- *“People get confused by the way I dress, but I’ve fallen in love with someone who is not confused.”*
- *“When people learn to make their own clothes, they don’t put up with clothes that don’t fit.”*
- *“Artists have an excuse to dress strangely, it’s much easier to get away with looking weird if you just say ‘don’t worry, it’s for art’”*

This workshop was partly based on an old uni project, but I added the graphic recording aspect because I wanted to challenge myself to do something unusual, and not be worried if a big crowd didn't show up for it (a big crowd did not turn up, lol, I still had a great time). I've always loved [The Grief Series by Ellie Harrison](https://www.griefseries.co.uk/home), and the way parts of her work are about using her skills as an artist to represent the thoughts and feelings of others in a beautiful composition. People love seeing my mindmaps in my journal, and I naturally and intuitively connect ideas and represent thought using mindmaps, so it was the obvious choice to use as a basis for graphic recording.

I'd love to do a huge scale graphic recording, perhaps over a whole day, with a huge ream of paper, arranged like a cassette, so I could write on it continuously without taking up a massive amount of space.
