title: Trying to decouple myself from proprietary software
---
A log of my progress moving away from software that requires me to rent services from companies.

## Completed
- **My Website** *23/01/25* I regard this as completed, because I have no real desire to ever host my domain locally. I have, however, moved the actual design and maintenance of my website from Wix to 11ty, served by Netlify. It's a lot more hassle but I would never go back (at this point).

## In Progress
- **Cloud Storage** *28/01/25* In the past few months, I've been trying out [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/install/), using a free account, provided by a company. I've been trying to use it more lately but its AutoUpload is a little bit unreliable. Everything syncs, just usually within an hour rather than seconds, which is annoying but not critically damaging. I have pretty much stopped using Google Photo to back up photos from my phone, which feels like a win. I haven't tested how good it is at collaborative editing. I'm sure it could be better if I self-hosted, but I'm not in a position to do that yet. 

- Currently, I have been trying out NextCloud using a free instance hosted by Tab.Digital, but their plans don't scale for me that well. You can either have a free account with 8gb, or a huge business account for Â£40 a month. So I'm looking at other companies that offer managed instances.

- **Media Center** *23/01/25* This week, I've started using Plex to organise films and TV, and I really like it so far. I don't have a way to serve to my phone remotely, but it's just nice to finally be able to organise all my random videos. I have several DVDs of acting masterclasses and recordings of plays, which are a faff to get out during classes to show as examples. This system will hopefully make it much easier to access what I need.

- **Document Editing** *28/01/25* Wow, I saw that Microsoft is changing peoples' subscriptions so that they are now paying for Copilot and I am noping the fuck out of that. I have redoubled my efforts to get used to LibreOffice. I'm not feeling optimistic about table formatting and fonts, but maybe I just need to get used to exporting more stuff as PDFs.

I also tried out [Etherpad](https://framapad.org/abc/en/) with a workshop class, and it seemed to work quite well (although doesn't have as many formatting options as Google Docs, which is a shame.)

## Nowhere Near/Aspirations
- **Surveys**
- **Videoconferencing** Not obvious what might be the best option, but [Sprout Video](https://sproutvideo.com/pricing) and [NextCloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/) seem to be the most promising. Particularly as I'm thinking of moving my cloud storage to NextCloud.
- **Music Streaming** Hoping to leave Spotify behind and use Plex or Jellyfin to host music.
