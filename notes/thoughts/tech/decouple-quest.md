title: Trying to decouple myself from proprietary software

A log of my progress moving away from software that requires me to rent services from companies.

## Completed
- **My Website** *23/01/25* I regard this as completed, because I have no real desire to ever host my domain locally. I have, however, moved the actual design and maintenance of my website from Wix to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It's a lot more hassle but I would never go back (at this point). [[whyweb|Read more here.]]
- **Note-taking** [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md/). I love the philosophy of 'linking my thinking'. I don't use the Zettelkasten system perfectly, but my notes have never been easier to sort and find things in.

## In Progress
- **Cloud Storage** *28/01/25* In the past few months, I've been trying out [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/install/), using a free account, provided by [Tab.Digital](https://cloud.tab.digital/). I've been trying to use it more lately but its AutoUpload is a little bit unreliable. Everything syncs, just usually within an hour rather than seconds, which is annoying but not critically damaging. I have pretty much stopped using Google Photo to back up photos from my phone, which feels like a win. I haven't tested how good it is at collaborative editing. I'm sure it could be better if I self-hosted, but I'm not in a position to do that yet. 
  - *UPDATE: 11/02/25* So, AutoUpload for photos seems to work pretty consistently for photos now, but refuses to sync backups of some really specific weird files. 
- I also use [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/) for files that are nice to sync between my phone and computer but which I would prefer were not on Cloud storage, like my music and my Obsidian notes.

- **Media Center** *23/01/25* This week, I've started using [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) to organise films and TV, and I really like it so far. I don't have a way to serve to my phone remotely, but it's just nice to finally be able to organise all my random videos. I have several DVDs of acting masterclasses and recordings of plays, which are a faff to get out during classes to show as examples. This system will hopefully make it much easier to access what I need.

- **Document Editing** *28/01/25* Wow, I saw that Microsoft is changing peoples' subscriptions so that they are now paying for Copilot and I am noping the fuck out of that. I have redoubled my efforts to get used to [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). I'm not feeling optimistic about table formatting and fonts, but maybe I just need to get used to exporting more stuff as PDFs. I also tried out [Etherpad](https://framapad.org/abc/en/) with a workshop class, and it seemed to work quite well (although doesn't have as many formatting options as Google Docs, which is a shame.)

- **Accounting** *11/02/25* Manager.io is my choice so far. I like that you can customise the interface to show as many or as few buttons as you need.

## Nowhere Near/Aspirations
- **Surveys** NextCloud has a utility for this, and there are lots of self-hosted options.
- **Videoconferencing** Not obvious what might be the best option, but [Sprout Video](https://sproutvideo.com/pricing) and [NextCloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/) seem to be the most promising. Particularly as I'm thinking of moving my cloud storage to NextCloud.
- **Music Streaming** Hoping to leave Spotify behind and use Plex or Jellyfin to host music. Also just using offline downloads for my most-listened collections.
- **Social Media** *11/02/25* I am trying to spend less time on social media. I have started a Signal group, where I am going to post links to fun stuff happening around my city. 11 people have already joined. I made the group in an attempt to help myself and people like me, to avoid using Facebook as the only way to find out when events are happening. In the past few days, I have removed Facebook from the main screen of my phone and turned off notifications. I have made a list of websites for small businesses and organisations who host fun indie events, and every day, I check what's coming up in the next few weeks and post it on the Signal group. When I run out of events, I look for local community newspaper websites, and charities, and post some of their links too.
- I'm enjoying Bluesky, a lot of the arts industry and my creative community has moved there, and there are good and bad points about the platform, but by God, it's setting a pretty decent example. However, I still find a lot of really good content on Mastodon, particularly for independent journalism, open source/homebrew tech.
