title: Technology and Me
---
Sometimes when I get stressed, I start coding. Coding can be frustrating of course, but I often find myself in a state where I am reading about the cool, logical construction and progression of commands, to be typed into a terminal, or fed from a script, and my brain feels relaxed and quiet. I mainly use a command line to execute scripts, but the process of learning to use it is quite [[cmdline|technologically liberating.]] In the same way, learning to use Hypertext has changed the way I interact with the web, and the way I think about the web as a tool. Hypertext has been [[textadvs|a creative outlet for me for a long time,]] and I am glad to return to it, in the process of [[whyweb|designing my own website.]]
