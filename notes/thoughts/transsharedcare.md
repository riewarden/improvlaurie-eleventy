title: What is Shared Care?

Shared Care is a UK National Health Service policy where a patient can give their GP a valid prescription from a private doctor, and acquire the prescribed medication through an NHS pharmacy, without having to pay the market rate for the prescription. 

For trans people in the UK, this means that in most cases, if you have a psychiatric diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria from a private psychiatrist, AND a prescription for Hormone Replacement Therapy from a private endocrinologist (a blood specialist), you can ask your GP to send your prescription for HRT to an NHS pharmacy, and acquire the prescription at the price you would pay for any other prescription on the NHS. Typically this is about £9 per month. If you were to buy HRT privately, it would be about £50-100 per month (But it really depends on what type of HRT it is). 

If you have a Shared Care plan, your GP can arrange free blood tests, but you still have to pay for private endocrinology appointments for your bloods to be assessed throughout your course of HRT. When you get off the waiting list for a Gender Identity Clinic, the clinic will take over your endocrinology, and you won't have to pay for the appointments any more.
