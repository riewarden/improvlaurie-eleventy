"As a completely new actor, I was both nervous and inexperienced in the whole theatre and stagecraft experience and was immensely proud to have been cast in ' The Prince'. However, it was not long before I found myself close to overwhelmed by almost everything - I felt like I was always in the wrong place, whispering and stumbling over my lines, struggling to even remember even the simplest of them..."

"I spoke to Laurie on numerous occasions for advice and guidance because I was worried that I would not be able to reach performance standard. Laurie's guidance was so helpful and always supportive, giving me not only welcome reassurance, but also the confidence I needed to feel that I wasn't picked in error, but because I was right for the part! (albeit, inexperienced!)"

"Over time, I started to understand what was going on around me, seeing Laurie's vision take shape and how my performance was part of something much bigger than all of us - such a wonderful experience, seeing everythinggo from bare bones to a finely tuned performance, and realising that small directorial decisions had such an impact on the play as a whole."

"I still remember the feeling of the first dress rehearsal, watching elements I did not understand suddenly make sense because of the scene setting, our positions on stage and even how close we were in certain scenes. As a new actor, it was so eye-opening and particularly humbling as I had no idea of the detail in those decisions before seeing it in real-time with my own eyes."

"I want to thank Laurie for his patience and encouragement - I don't know how I could have reached a point where I would be projecting my voice to the back of the theatre, let alone be part of a group who received nightly standing ovations without his guidance and direction."

"And to top it off, Laurie was always so humble and pleasant to work with, even though I felt so unworthy of that stage at the start, he coaxed out the best in me and definitely showed me what was possible, and is perhaps responsible for my enthusiasm for performing again!"
