## Recipe links
- [Simple flatbreads](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/no-yeast-pizza-dough)
    - These make great pizza bases.
- [Cheat's Spinach Lasagne](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/spinach-lasagna-recipe/)
  - Incredible but very simple lasagne where you don't have to make separate sauces, you just layer up passata, sausage meat, ricotta and spinach and pasta.
- [Pajeon](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/pajeon)
  - Super simple midweek meal. I like to make a cheaper version that replaces the seafood for lardons. But don't forget to put enough oil on to cook the pancake, the lardons don't create enough.
- [[recipecracker|Laurie's Rosemary and Garlic Crackers]]
  - So tasty.
- [How to use the seasoning triangle](https://youtu.be/mFzCV2wI6Jc?si=VcXND9Nnb7riUSsa) - This YouTube video is a practical demonstration of how the seasoning triangle works. The seasoning triangle is a concept that helps you to taste food, and understand what seasoning to add: salt, sweet, or acid.
- [Spicy Corn, Black Bean and Feta Salad](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/spicy-corn-black-bean-feta-salad) - Top tier salad tbh. 

## My Salad Formula
- **Fat(1):** Feta, avocado, mozzarella, goat's cheese.
- **Protein (1)**: Chickpeas, chicken, boiled eggs, marinated tofu, beans.
- **Veg (2)**: Celery, tomato, carrot, bell pepper, sweetcorn.
- **Punch (1)**: Red onion, spring onion, pickles, wild garlic buds, chives, mango, pomegranate seeds, sauerkraut. 
- **Other:** croutons, couscous, pasta, rice, fonio.
- **Tips:**
   	- If you want to eat more salad, make tasty salad.
   	- Season everything! With a bit of salt and pepper.
   	- Don't be afraid to add more proteins if you don't feel full after eating it.
   	- If you roast veg in oil and herbs/spices, it creates its own sauce that can season the rest of the salad.

## Fermenting
I have also recently started exploring [[fermentwhatis|fermentation]]. I'm not going to explain how to do it on this page, but fermenting is a great way to preserve and pickle vegetables (and sometimes blueberries, if you're [one of them Noma mad lads](https://www.illinoistimes.com/food-drink/foundations-of-flavor-the-noma-guide-to-fermentation-11448252)).
### Tips
- [Join Fermenting Friends](https://www.facebook.com/share/d4zh3ZfDae5VqaYa/) Cannot reccomend this group highly enough. Suitable for beginners, lots of community resources on making sourdough, kraut, kimchi, kefir, ginger beer, any food with little guys in it. Dawn Smit is a legend. I wish there was a way to collate all the resources this group has into a format that is more navigable than a Facebook Group. They also have a group chat where you can, look for healthy single SCOBYs in your area.
- [Revolution Fermentation recipes](https://revolutionfermentation.com/en/) Good simple recipes to follow here.
- **Don't buy a fancy jar with a valve sticking out of the top!** Kilner-style jars with a rubber seal are cheaper and do the same thing. You need a vessel with a seal like this because it allows pressurised Co2 produced by microorganisms to escape, so the jar doesn't smash, but it prevents oxygen getting in.
- [Edible Alchemy](https://www.instagram.com/ediblealchemy.co/) on Instagram has lots of fun videos and inspiration for fermentation. Alexis, the presenter, has boundless enthusiasm and resourcefulness, and her family have been fermenting for generations.
