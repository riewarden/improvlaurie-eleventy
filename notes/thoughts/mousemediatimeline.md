A non-comprehensive timeline of media featuring anthropomorphic mice. I've also included other cultural events relating to mice that seem relevant and influential to a public preoccupation with mice. If you know of any media that you think I should add, especially media that is not in English, feel free to email me at **laurence(@)improvlaurie(.)co(.)uk** - minus the brackets.

Around this time, the following piece of Nazi propaganda appears in a German newspaper:

*"Mickey Mouse is the most miserable ideal ever revealed. Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal. Away with Jewish brutalization of the people! Down with Mickey Mouse! Wear the Swastika Cross!"*

Decades later, Art Spiegelman is inspired by this antisemitic sentiment to depict Jews as mice, in his graphic novel 'Maus'. The quote appears at the beginning of the second volume.

#### 1962
Scientist Bob Calhoun [publishes research into overcrowding](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-doomed-mouse-utopia-that-inspired-the-rats-of-nimh), based on experiments on rats and mice. Calhoun's language when describing the mice is very anthropomorphic, and he seemed to believe the mice were highly comparable with humans. 

An author called Robert C. O'Brien visits Calhoun's lab at The National Institute For Mental Health while it is in use, and the work becomes one of the influences for O'Brien's book, 'Mrs Frisby and The Rats of Nimh', which is later adapted into a film.

#### 1979
Following creative differences on the production of Disney's 'The Black Cauldron' and 'The Fox and the Hound', and internal politics around the treatment of animators, and Bluth's objections to Disney's budget cuts affecting animation quality, Don Bluth leaves Disney to establish the animation house 'Don Bluth Entertainment'.

#### 1981
'Danger Mouse' is released on ITV. It is created by Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall, and is inspired by 1960s TV show 'Danger Man', and James Bond. Having a mouse main character gives the animation team space to be silly and experimental. [(source)](https://web.archive.org/web/20111003214234/http://danger-mouse.net/cosgrove.html)

#### 1982
'The Secret of Nimh' released by Don Bluth Entertainment, the company's first feature-length film. The film included many experimental and expensive animation techniques, in comparison to Disney's low budget methods they were using at this time.

#### 1983
The Observer publishes an article noting that mouse fanciers have a long history in the uk, particularly among Yorkshire miners, in industrial Manchester and in the East End of London.

#### 1986
Brian Jaques publishes the first 'Redwall' book, inspired by his childhood, growing up during WW2, and his memories of the RAF and the dockworkers in Liverpool. Jaques says: *"Mice are my heroes because, like children, mice are little and have to learn to be courageous and use their wits."* [(source)](http://www.redwall.org/ideas.html)

'The Great Mouse Detective' is released by Disney.

'An American Tail' is released by Don Bluth Entertainment. Don Bluth suggests the main character should have an American name but Steven Spielberg names him after his Jewish grandfather, Fievel. 

Despite dodging union laws (and by 'dodging' I mean: Bluth moved the whole studio to Ireland to evade animation union laws) 'An American Tail' is a huge success. On an $9mil budget, the film makes $84mil at box office, and becomes the highest-grossing non-Disney film at the time, and beating Disney's own mouse film of that year at box office takings (which only made $38.7mil.)

The first volume of 'Maus' by Art Spiegelman is published by Pantheon Books. This is a graphic novel based on Spiegelman's father's real-life experiences as a holocaust survivor. Spiegelman believes that his former classmate, Don Bluth, plagiarised his idea of depicting persecuted Jews as mice, but never presses charges.
