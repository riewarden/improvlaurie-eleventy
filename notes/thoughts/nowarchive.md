- **Wearing:** Red ski jacket, black shiny leather boots, and a mustard coloured cowl that I crocheted at Fake Christmas.
- **Excited about:** Giving my Christmas presents to Rory and James. Decanting Limoncello with Rory, visiting the sauna with james. People tasting the edible gifts I made for them. Thinking about silly fun stuff to do over Christmas, playing 'Thank Goodness You're Here', finishing 'Chants of Senaar', New Year's with Rory.

# Nov 7th 2024
- **Reading:** The Practice and Theory of Anarchism by Ruth Kinna, as well as two original plays from Lace Market Theatre members.
- **Watching:** Kaos, Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey, SortedFood, Gastronauts, Make Some Noise.
- **Listening to:** [Radio Paradise](https://radioparadise.com/), which is a community internet radio that just always seems to be playing awesome music. I love their interface too, which shows the lyrics of the song playing, as well as album art, and a Wikipedia entry for the artist, as well as a box where you can see comments left by listeners over the years on currently playing songs.
- **Wearing:** Red ski jacket, as it's cold out. I also had my [[badgejacket|photo taken in my badge jacket at CityArts]], so I've been trying to wear it more in case people recognise my cool jacket! Thanks to James, I'm also wearing [a white poppy on behalf of the Peace Pledge Union](https://www.ppu.org.uk/remembrance-white-poppies), as it's the month of Rememberance.
- **Excited about:** My involvement in the [Notts Trans Hub residency at The New Art Exchange](https://www.nae.org.uk/reside-notts-trans-hub/). It's such a cool place and I am going to be doing a thing there on the 30th November (watch this space). Thinking about directing The Prince at Lace Market Theatre next year. I keep talking to people who are excited and who think I will do a great job. My sister's wedding is in less than two days!!! omg!!! and Rory has an amazing outfit for it, and I bought my first proper suit, not just random bits and bobs from supermarkets. Me and James are heading to Fake Christmas in December, we made some special pickles the other day. My secret santa gift arrived and its AMAZING and I can't wait for it to be opened.
- **Annoyed about:** My job!! Won't go into it. Also, that people don't preserve much food in the UK and I would like for there to be more learning resources and training, so that people would be able to use up food more and stop it going to waste.
- **Planning for:**  Me and Rory are planning to make some tasty treats for Christmas......what could they beeee??

# Aug 30th 2024
- **Reading:** Black Comedians on Black Comedy by Darryl Littleton. [Read it here on Archive.org.](https://archive.org/details/blackcomedianson00litt)
- **Watching:** SortedFood, Make Some Noise.
- **Listening to:** The Goon Show. Almost constantly. Particularly while doing boring things at work, and when getting to sleep. I'm learning so much about the history of comedy in the UK from it. It's such a wild and ridiculous show, but it also couldn't exist without the devastating impacts of WW2 on Spike Milligan's life, and I find that really interesting.
- **Wearing:** Bright yellow hoodie, converse, peaked cap, a leather monogrammed pocket attached to my belt which holds my swiss army knife.
- **Excited about:** My strawberry and raspberry kombucha, which has grown from a culture given to me by James. Robin Hood Improv next week, where I will be stewarding and perfoming and eating lots of food at Bombay Deli. Teaching with Lee in September. My show in October. I made some home-made brunch bars from peanut butter, oats, syrup and chocolate chips. Me and Rory made a delicious beetroot curry together, using a recipe reccomended by James. Rory also bought blinds for their windows at their flat and I haven't seen them yet, but in the photos they look great. Thinking about Fake Christmas, a special celebration that I will be attending with James in December.
- **Annoyed about:** Bad stuff at work. Bored at work. Worried about work changing at the end of September. Adult reforms to trans healthcare in UK. Mermaids struggling for funding. Shop Zero Nottingham losing their physical venue.
- **Planning for:** [Robin Hood International Improv Festival](https://www.robinhoodimprov.co.uk/) in September. My talk at [Queer Arts Collective](https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/project/nottinghams-queer-arts-collective/) in September.  My sister’s hen do in October. Learning lines for [Some Other Mirror performance in October](https://lambethfringe.com/events/some-other-mirrors). Still haven't got a set designer for The Prince in 2025. On committee for 2025-26 season at Lace Market Theatre. Looking for a house. Thinking about Christmas presents.

- **Annoyed about:** PowerAutomate being pushed at my day job to compensate for management’s reluctance to pay for reliable software and training. Wes Streeting and Blue Labour. Weird Javascript stuff.
