- **Excited about:** [Auditions for The Prince](https://lacemarkettheatre.co.uk/LaceMarketTheatre.dll/WhatsOn?EventType=0&Event=6667559) (A production I am directing from April). Robin Hood Improv planning. Starting to use Plex for organising my media. 3-year anniversary with Rory this weekend, 2-year anniversary with James next month.

I'm thinking of starting a business to collect together the various arts activities and community aspirations I have, make myself look more professional, and also make it easier to get access to certain kinds of funding and sponsorship.
