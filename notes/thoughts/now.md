- **Reading:** The Practice and Theory of Anarchism by Ruth Kinna, as well as two original plays from Lace Market Theatre members.
- **Watching:** Kaos, Dimension 20: A Starstruck Odyssey, SortedFood, Gastronauts, Make Some Noise.
- **Listening to:** [Radio Paradise](https://radioparadise.com/), which is a community internet radio that just always seems to be playing awesome music. I love their interface too, which shows the lyrics of the song playing, as well as album art, and a Wikipedia entry for the artist, as well as a box where you can see comments left by listeners over the years on currently playing songs.
- **Wearing:** Red ski jacket, as it's cold out. I also had my [[badgejacket|photo taken in my badge jacket at CityArts]], so I've been trying to wear it more in case people recognise my cool jacket! I'm also wearing [a white poppy on behalf of the Peace Pledge Union](https://www.ppu.org.uk/remembrance-white-poppies), as it's the month of Rememberance.
- **Excited about:** 
- **Annoyed about:** 
- **Planning for:**
