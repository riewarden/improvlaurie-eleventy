- **Reading:** Nothing. But just ordered some exciting new books with some money from the NAE.
- **Watching:** The Midnight Gospel, Over The Garden Wall, Hilda, Ashens Advent Calendar.
- **Listening to:** Christmas songs, Radio Paradise and the Ferment Radio Podcast.
- **Wearing:** Red ski jacket, and a mustard coloured cowl that I crocheted at Fake Christmas.
- **Excited about:** Giving my Christmas presents to Rory and James. Decanting Limoncello with Rory, visiting the sauna with james. People tasting the edible gifts I made for them. Thinking about silly fun stuff to do over Christmas, playing 'Thank Goodness You're Here', finishing 'Chants of Senaar', New Year's with Rory. 
- **Annoyed about:** Work, automation, new software at work, the puberty blockers ban.
- **Planning for:** Stuff to do over xmas, potentially host my own server with some equipment from my cousin, read books, finish a sculpture of a mouse head that I've been working on forever.
