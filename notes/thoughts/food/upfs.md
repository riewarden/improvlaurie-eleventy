title: UPFs
---
This is a still-emerging field of study into foods which undergo intense processing to turn them into products that are profitable and often addictive. The NOVA Scale is a proposed way of categorising the level of processing which has gone into a food product. You can read an explanation of it [here](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nova). In brief, the article uses the NOVA scale to define Ultra-Processed Foods as the following:

*"Ultra-processed foods, such as soft drinks, sweet or savoury packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products and pre-prepared frozen dishes, are not modified foods but formulations made mostly or entirely from substances derived from foods and additives, with little if any intact Group 1 food."*

This [meta-analysis from The British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310) suggests that it's reasonable to be wary of health concerns related to UPFs. If UPFs form a large part of a person's diet, this may contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, anxiety and depression, and type 2 diabetes.
