I think about food and the culture around it a lot. In 2024 I became interested in [[upfs|Ultra Processed Foods.]]

The thoughts that I have relate to:

- People who can't afford to make food from scratch are shamed for it (afford: time, money, energy)
- That some people get to have the real food and other people settle for the repreesntation of it.
- [The Chorleywood Method](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13670278) has deeply obfuscated what people think 'real bread' is.
- How many people would stop buying Coca-Cola if we showed them how to make their own fizzy drinks at home, using [kombucha](https://brewbuch.com/how-to-make-kombucha/) and [ginger bugs](https://www.fermentingforfoodies.com/catching-ginger-bug/)?

So far, I've written a poem called [[poemlabrador|Labrador]], which expresses some of my feelings about processed food. But to be honest, it's such a huge area that feels so inflammatory, and I'm never sure where to start making creative things from it. I feel awkward talking about Chorleywood because nearly everyone has a loaf of Chorleywood in their kitchen. And it becomes yet another thing for people to feel they're supposed to be guilty about.
