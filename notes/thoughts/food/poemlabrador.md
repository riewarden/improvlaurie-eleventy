In the future, there is a room you can pay to stand in,<br>
and it looks like someone's parents' kitchen.<br>
And in the middle of it, there is a vinyl sculpture of a loaf of bread.<br>
It looks like it just came out the oven.<br>
Not clear if there is an aroma coming from a vent,<br>
or if you're inferring that there is an aroma.<br>

In the future, this is what money from your job buys.<br>
And you only had to pay 52p to stand here. Bargain.<br>
Standing here is a much better thing to do than simply<br>
not remembering how good bread used to be.<br>
Expecting anything more is futile.<br>
The hormone for that was bred out of you.
