"It was an absolute delight to work with Laurie. I have worked with a lot of directors and Laurie is one of the few who recognise that putting the well being of the cast and crew first inspires growth and creativity, which in turn, results in a brilliant production. He encouraged open collaboration, taking a guiding approach with his performers working to build their confidence throughout the rehearsal process but also knowing when a more direct approach was required. I look forward to working with him again."
