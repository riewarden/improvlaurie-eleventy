title: Improv and me

I started practising improv in 2018, and continue it today. I've done longform, shortform, been on a house team, I ran improv sessions for Leeds University Union for 3 years, one of which was entirely online. Presently, my biggest contribution to improv is being part of the organising comittee for Robin Hood International Improv Festival.

1. I am kinder and more open.
2. I worry less about how to start.
3. I embrace and utilise my mundanity.
4. I play with form.
5. I don't start with a script any more.
6.
