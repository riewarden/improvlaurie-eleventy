title: Some Other Mirror
---
If youâ€™ve known me for any length of time, you will know about Some Other Mirror. This is my [[theatreiteration|iterative]] solo show about transmasculinity, which I started developing in late 2020, and am still working on, 3-ish years later. It started as a Zoom show, out of necessity, and has since moved to in-person performance, always with audience on multiple sides. This section has some notes on how I developed the piece, as it is continually being [[SOMrevise|revised]].
