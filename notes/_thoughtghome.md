This is the entrance to the thought garden. I am an interdisciplinary person, and while linear blogging is great for some things, it was important for me to create my own website because I wanted some non-linear space to get across my personality. The links below lead to a few topics that I'm interested in, and the links within those topics lead to a constellation of related ideas. Some of the notes here are a bit personal, but it should be easy to tell what links go to information, and what go to something less categorisable.
