# About Me
I'm a theatre practitioner and educator based in Nottingham. I trained in Theatre and Performance at The University of Leeds, and have practised performing arts since 2009. I have been teaching performance skills to adults since 2018, and currently teach theatre workshops at Nottingham Playhouse.
